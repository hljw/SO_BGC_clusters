	abstract = {A new model is presented for multisite statistical downscaling of temperature and precipitation using convolutional conditional neural processes (convCNPs). ConvCNPs are a recently developed class of models that allow deep learning techniques to be applied to off-the-grid spatio-temporal data. This model has a substantial advantage over existing downscaling methods in that the trained model can be used to generate multisite predictions at an arbitrary set of locations, regardless of the availability of training data. The convCNP model is shown to outperform an ensemble of existing downscaling techniques over Europe for both temperature and precipitation taken from the VALUE intercomparison project. The model also outperforms an approach that uses Gaussian processes to interpolate single-site downscaling models at unseen locations. Importantly, substantial improvement is seen in the representation of extreme precipitation events. These results indicate that the convCNP is a robust downscaling model suitable for generating localised projections for use in climate impact studies, and motivates further research into applications of deep learning techniques in statistical downscaling.},

	abstract = {Ocean ventilation is the transfer of tracers and young water from the surface down into the ocean interior. The tracers that can be transported to depth include anthropogenic heat and carbon, both of which are critical to understanding future climate trajectories. Ventilation occurs in both high- and midlatitude regions, but it is the southern midlatitudes that are responsible for the largest fraction of anthropogenic heat and carbon uptake; such Southern Ocean ventilation is the focus of this review. Southern Ocean ventilation occurs through a chain of interconnected mechanisms, including the zonally averaged meridional overturning circulation, localized subduction, eddy-driven mixing along isopycnals, and lateral transport by subtropical gyres. To unravel the complex pathways of ventilation and reconcile conflicting results, here we assess the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms, emphasizing the three-dimensional and temporally varying nature of the ventilation of the Southern Ocean pycnocline. We conclude that Southern Ocean ventilation depends on multiple processes and that simplified frameworks that explain ventilation changes through a single process are insufficient.

The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s.

	abstract = {We document the development of the first version of the U.K. Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1.},

We present a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system, IceNet. The system has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. We show that IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events.

Many studies of these topics have been performed by professional planetary scientists who are relatively unfamiliar with research in fields such as gender studies and sociology. As a result, they adopt a normative view of gender as a binary choice of 'male' or 'female,' leaving planetary scientists whose genders do not fit within that model out of such research entirely. Reductive frameworks of gender and an overemphasis on quantification as an indicator of gendered phenomena are harmful to people of marginalized genders, especially those who live at the intersections of multiple axes of marginalization such as race, disability, and socioeconomic status. In order for the planetary science community to best serve its marginalized members as we move into the next decade, a new paradigm must be established. This paper aims to address the future of gender equity in planetary science by recommending better survey practices and institutional policies based on a more profound approach to gender.},

Five vertical regimes are identified, and areas of larger variability highlighted. Three spatial regimes are captured: Off-Shelf, Eastern and Central Troughs. The on-shelf profiles further show a separation between cold and warm modes. The variability is higher north of Burke Island and at the southern end of the Eastern Trough, which reflects the convergence of different mCDW pathways between the Eastern and the Central Trough.

            A potentially irreversible threshold in Antarctic ice shelf melting would be crossed if the ocean cavity beneath the large Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf were to become flooded with warm water from the deep ocean. Previous studies have identified this possibility, but there is great uncertainty as to how easily it could occur. Here, we show, using a coupled ice sheet-ocean model forced by climate change scenarios, that any increase in ice shelf melting is likely to be preceded by an extended period of reduced melting. Climate change weakens the circulation beneath the ice shelf, leading to colder water and reduced melting. Warm water begins to intrude into the cavity when global mean surface temperatures rise by approximately 7 °C above pre-industrial, which is unlikely to occur this century. However, this result should not be considered evidence that the region is unconditionally stable. Unless global temperatures plateau, increased melting will eventually prevail.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) is a coherent circulation feature that rings the Antarctic continental shelf and regulates the ﬂow of water toward the Antarctic coastline. The structure and variability of the ASC inﬂuences key processes near the Antarctic coastline that have global implications, such as the melting of Antarctic ice shelves and water mass formation that determines the strength of the global overturning circulation. Recent theoretical, modeling, and observational advances have revealed new dynamical properties of the ASC, making it timely to review. Earlier reviews of the ASC focused largely on local classiﬁcations of water properties of the ASC’s primary front. Here we instead provide a classiﬁcation of the current’s frontal structure based on the dynamical mechanisms that govern both the along-slope and cross-slope circulation; these two modes of circulation are strongly coupled, similar to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Highly variable motions, such as dense overﬂows, tides, and eddies are shown to be critical components of cross-slope and cross-shelf exchange, but understanding of how the distribution and intensity of these processes will evolve in a changing climate remains poor due to observational and modeling limitations. Results linking the ASC to larger modes of climate variability, such as El Niño, show that the ASC is an integral part of global climate. An improved dynamical understanding of the ASC is still needed to accurately model and predict future Antarctic sea ice extent, the stability of the Antarctic ice sheets, and the Southern Ocean’s contribution to the global carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {The location of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) is mapped in the Southern Indian Ocean by decomposing the shape of temperature and salinity proﬁles into vertical modes using a functional Principal Component Analysis. We deﬁne the PF as the northernmost minimum of temperature at the subsurface and represent it as a linear combination of the ﬁrst three modes. This method is applied on an ocean reanalysis data set and on in situ observations, revealing a seasonal variability of the PF latitudinal position that is most pronounced between the Conrad Rise and the Kerguelen Plateau. This shift coincides with variations in the transport across the Northern Kerguelen Plateau. We suggest that seasonal changes of the upper stratiﬁcation may drive the observed variability of the PF, with potentially large implications for the pathways and residence time of water masses over the plateau and the phytoplankton bloom extending southeast of the Kerguelen Islands.},

	abstract = {We consider the relative advantages of two advanced data assimilation systems, 4-D-Var and ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF), currently in use or under consideration for operational implementation. With the Lorenz model, we explore the impact of tuning assimilation parameters such as the assimilation window length and background error covariance in 4-D-Var, variance inﬂation in EnKF, and the effect of model errors and reduced observation coverage. For short assimilation windows EnKF gives more accurate analyses. Both systems reach similar levels of accuracy if long windows are used for 4-D-Var. For infrequent observations, when ensemble perturbations grow non-linearly and become nonGaussian, 4-D-Var attains lower errors than EnKF. If the model is imperfect, the 4-D-Var with long windows requires weak constraint. Similar results are obtained with a quasi-geostrophic channel model. EnKF experiments made with the primitive equations SPEEDY model provide comparisons with 3-D-Var and guidance on model error and ‘observation localization’. Results obtained using operational models and both simulated and real observations indicate that currently EnKF is becoming competitive with 4-D-Var, and that the experience acquired with each of these methods can be used to improve the other. A table summarizes the pros and cons of the two methods.},

Eddy composite MLD anomalies are shallow in cyclones, deep in anticyclones, and increase in magnitude with eddy amplitude. Their magnitudes show a pronounced seasonal modulation roughly following the depth of the climatological mixed layer. Weak eddies of the relatively quiescent SO subtropics feature peak late-winter perturbations of 610 m. Much larger MLD perturbations occur over the vigorous eddies originating along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and SO western boundary current systems, with late-winter peaks of 230 m and 160 m in the average over cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy cores (a difference of   100 m). The asymmetry between modest shallow cyclonic and pronounced deep anticyclonic anomalies is systematic and not accompanied by corresponding asymmetries in eddy amplitude. Nonetheless, the net deepening of the climatological SO mixed layer by this asymmetry in eddy MLD perturbations is estimated to be small (few meters). Eddies are shown to enhance SO MLD variability with peaks in late winter and eddy-intense regions. Anomalously deep late-winter mixed layers occur disproportionately within the cores of anticyclonic eddies, suggesting the mesoscale heightens the frequency of deep winter surface-mixing events along the eddy-intense regions of the SO. The eddy modulation in MLD reported here provides a pathway via which the oceanic mesoscale can impact air-sea ﬂuxes of heat and carbon, the ventilation of water masses, and biological productivity across the SO.},

The relative importance of these mechanisms in the Southern Ocean is uncertain, as year-round observations in this area have been limited. We use a novel physical-biogeochemical state estimate of the Southern Ocean to construct a closed DIC budget of the top 650 m and investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the different components of the carbon system. The dominant mechanisms of variability in upper ocean DIC depend on location and time and space scales considered. Advective transport is the most inﬂuential mechanism and governs the local DIC budget across the 10 day–5 year timescales analyzed. Diffusive effects are nearly negligible. The large-scale transport structure is primarily set by upwelling and downwelling, though both the lateral ageostrophic and geostrophic transports are signiﬁcant. In the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the carbon budget components are also inﬂuenced by the presence of topography and biological hot spots. In the subtropics, evaporation and air-sea CO2 ﬂux primarily balances the sink due to biological production and advective transport. Finally, in the subpolar region sea ice processes, which change the seawater volume and thus the DIC concentration, compensate the large impact of the advective transport and modulate the timing of biological activity and air-sea CO2 ﬂux.},

In this study we build a statistical climatology of the temperature and salinity ﬁelds of the upper 380 m of the Antarctic margin. We use a comprehensive compilation of observational datasets including the proﬁles gathered by instrumented marine mammals. The mapping method consists ﬁrst of a decomposition in vertical modes of the combined temperature and salinity proﬁles. Then the resulting principal components are optimally interpolated on a regular grid and the monthly climatological proﬁles are reconstructed, providing a physically plausible representation of the ocean. The ASF is located with a contour method and a gradient method applied on the temperature ﬁeld, two complementary approaches that provide a complete view of the ASF structure. The front extends from the Amundsen Sea to the eastern Weddell Sea and closely tracks the continental shelf break. It is associated with a sharp temperature gradient that is stronger in winter and weaker in summer. The emergence of the front in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen sectors appears to be seasonally variable (slightly more westward in winter than in summer). Investigation of the density gradients across the shelf break indicates a winter slowdown of the baroclinic component of the Antarctic Slope Current at the near surface, in contrast with the seasonal variability of the temperature gradient.},

To tackle this task, we use satellite observations of sea level anomalies and sea surface temperature (SST) as well as in situ temperature and salinity measurements from proﬁling ﬂoats. Over the period 1997–2010, we identiﬁed over a million mesoscale eddy instances and were able to track about 105 of them over 1 month or more. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the boundary current systems, and the regions where they interact are hot spots of eddy presence, representing also the birth places and graveyards of most eddies. These hot spots contrast strongly to areas shallower than about 2000 m, where mesoscale eddies are essentially absent, likely due to topographical steering. Anticyclones tend to dominate the southern subtropical gyres, and cyclones the northern ﬂank of the ACC. Major causes of regional polarity dominance are larger formation numbers and lifespans, with a contribution of differential propagation pathways of long-lived eddies. Areas of dominance of one polarity are generally congruent with the same polarity being longer-lived, bigger, of larger amplitude, and more intense. Eddies extend down to at least 2000 m. In the ACC, eddies show near surface temperature and salinity maxima, whereas eddies in the subtropical areas generally have deeper anomaly maxima, presumably inherited from their origin in the boundary currents. The temperature and salinity signatures of the average eddy suggest that their tracer anomalies are a result of both trapping in the eddy core and stirring.},

	abstract = {The stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) depends on ocean heat transport toward its base and remains a source of uncertainty in sea level rise prediction. The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC), a major boundary current of the ocean's global circulation, serves as a dynamic gateway for heat transport toward Antarctica. Here, we use observations collected from the Bellingshausen Sea to propose a mechanistic explanation for the initiation of the westward‐ﬂowing ASC. Waters modiﬁed throughout the Bellingshausen Sea by ocean‐sea‐ice and ocean‐ice‐shelf interactions are exported to the continental slope in a narrow, topographically steered western boundary current. This focused outﬂow produces a localized front at the shelf break that supports the emerging ASC. This mechanism emphasizes the importance of buoyancy forcing, integrated over the continental shelf, as opposed to local wind forcing, in the generation mechanism and suggests the potential for remote control of melt rates of WAIS' largest ice shelves. Plain Language Summary The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) is an ocean current that separates warmer, offshore water from colder waters over the continental shelf. The ASC helps to control the movement of warm water on to the continental shelf and ultimately under ﬂoating ice shelves. Warm ocean water has contributed to the melting and thinning of West Antarctic ice shelves in recent decades. This study describes where and how the ASC ﬁrst forms in West Antarctica. Previous studies have suggested that the ASC responds primarily to atmospheric winds blowing over the current itself, whereas here it is argued that processes occurring over a much larger region of the west Antarctic continental shelf may determine the strength and structure of the ASC. These results contribute to our understanding of the longterm, for example, decades or longer, evolution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic global surface warming is proportional to cumulative carbon emissions1–3; this relationship is partly determined by the uptake and storage of heat and carbon by the ocean4. The rates and patterns of ocean heat and carbon storage are influenced by ocean transport, such as mixing and large-scale circulation5–10. However, existing climate models do not accurately capture the observed patterns of ocean warming, with a large spread in their projections of ocean circulation and ocean heat uptake8,11. Additionally, assessing the influence of ocean circulation changes (specifically, the redistribution of heat by resolved advection) on patterns of observed and simulated ocean warming remains a challenge. Here we establish a linear relationship between the heat and carbon uptake of the ocean in response to anthropogenic emissions. This relationship is determined mainly by intrinsic parameters of the Earth system—namely, the ocean carbon buffer capacity, the radiative forcing of carbon dioxide and the carbon inventory of the ocean. We use this relationship to reveal the effect of changes in ocean circulation from carbon dioxide forcing on patterns of ocean warming in both observations and global Earth system models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We show that historical patterns of ocean warming are shaped by ocean heat redistribution, which CMIP5 models simulate poorly. However, we find that projected patterns of heat storage are primarily dictated by the pre-industrial ocean circulation (and small changes in unresolved ocean processes)—that is, by the patterns of added heat owing to ocean uptake of excess atmospheric heat rather than ocean warming by circulation changes. Climate models show more skill in simulating ocean heat storage by the pre-industrial circulation compared to heat redistribution, indicating that warming patterns of the ocean may become more predictable as the climate warms.},

	abstract = {To investigate the role of tides in Weddell Sea ocean-ice shelf melt interactions, and resulting consequences for ocean properties and sea ice interactions, we develop a regional ocean-sea ice model configuration, with time-varying ocean boundary and atmospheric forcing, including the deep open ocean (at 2.5–4 km horizontal resolution), the southwestern continental shelf (≈2.5 km), and the adjacent cavities of eastern Weddell, Larsen, and Filchner-Ronne ice shelves (FRIS, 1.5–2.5 km). Simulated circulation, water mass, and ice shelf melt properties compare overall well with available open ocean and cavity observational knowledge. Tides are shown to enhance the kinetic energy of the time-varying flow in contact with the ice shelves, thereby increasing melt. This dynamically driven impact of tides on net melting is to almost 90\% compensated by cooling through the meltwater that is produced but not quickly exported from regions of melting in the Weddell Sea cold-cavity regime. The resulting systematic tide-driven enhancement of both produced meltwater and its refreezing on ascending branches of, especially the FRIS, cavity circulation acts to increase net ice shelf melting (by 50\% in respect to the state without tides, ≈50 Gt yr−1). In addition, tides also increase the melt-induced FRIS cavity circulation, and the meltwater export by the FRIS outflow. Simulations suggest attendant changes on the open-ocean southwestern continental shelf, characterized by overall freshening and small year-round sea ice thickening, as well as in the deep southwestern Weddell Sea in the form of a marked freshening of newly formed bottom waters.},

	abstract = {Argo-type proﬁling ﬂoats do not receive satellite positioning while under sea ice. Common practice is to approximate unknown positions by linearly interpolating latitude-longitude between known positions before and after ice cover, although it has been suggested that some improvement may be obtained by interpolating along contours of planetary-geostrophic potential vorticity. Proﬁles with linearly interpolated positions represent 16\% of the Southern Ocean Argo data set; consequences arising from this approximation have not been quantiﬁed. Using three distinct data sets from the Weddell Gyre—10-day satellite-tracked Argo ﬂoats, daily-tracked RAFOS-enabled ﬂoats, and a particle release simulation in the Southern Ocean State Estimate—we perform a data withholding experiment to assess position uncertainty in latitude-longitude and potential vorticity coordinates as a function of time since last ﬁx. A spatial correlation analysis using the ﬂoat data provides temperature and salinity uncertainty estimates as a function of distance error. Combining the spatial correlation scales and the position uncertainty, we estimate uncertainty in temperature and salinity as a function of duration of position loss. Maximum position uncertainty for interpolation during 8 months without position data is 116 ± 148 km for latitude-longitude and 92 ± 121 km for potential vorticity coordinates. The estimated maximum uncertainty in local temperature and salinity over the entire 2,000-m proﬁles during 8 months without position data is 0.66 ∘C and 0.15 psu in the upper 300 m and 0.16 ∘C and 0.01 psu below 300 m.},

	abstract = {The decadal to multidecadal temperature variability of the intermediate (700–2,000 m) North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (SPG) signiﬁcantly imprints the global pattern of ocean heat uptake. Here, the origins and dominant pathways of this variability are investigated with an ocean analysis product (EN4), an ocean state estimate (ECCOv4), and idealized modeling approaches. Sustained increases and decreases of intermediate temperature in the SPG correlate with long‐lasting warm and cold states of the upper ocean with the largest anomalous vertical heat exchanges conﬁned to the vicinity of continental boundaries and strong ocean currents. In particular, vertical diffusive processes along the boundaries of the Labrador, Irminger, and Newfoundland basins are important drivers of the recent intermediate depth warming trend observed during 1996–2014. The overall effect of those processes is captured by a one‐dimensional diffusive model with appropriate boundary‐like parametrization and demonstrated through the boundary‐focused downward propagation of a passive tracer in a 3‐D numerical simulation. Our results imply that the slow and quasi‐periodic ventilation of intermediate thermohaline properties and associated heat uptake in the SPG are not strictly driven by convection‐restratiﬁcation events in the open seas but also receives a key contribution from boundary sinking and mixing. Increased skill for modeling and predicting intermediate‐depth ocean properties in the North Atlantic will hence require the appropriate representation of surface‐deep dynamical connections within the boundary currents encircling Greenland and Newfoundland. Plain Language Summary The subarctic basins of the North Atlantic Ocean play a fundamental role in regulating the climate system. This occurs notably throughout direct connections between the ocean surface (and hence the atmosphere) and deep oceanic layers, which enable the long‐term sequestration and subsequent propagation of physical and biogeochemical anomalies (e.g., heat and carbon). Here, we employ a multitool approach to investigate the mechanisms by which anomalous heat can penetrate downward in this region. Historical observations gathered during 1950–2016 and combined with idealized modeling strategy suggest that decadal temperature trends in the intermediate layer strongly correlate with long‐lasting warm and cold states of the upper ocean, suggesting potential for ﬁrst‐order predictability. Focusing on the well‐observed era (1992–2016) using a realistic ocean reanalysis and tracer propagation experiments in a numerical model, we show that the associated downward penetration of temperature anomalies receives an important contribution from mixing and advection within the energetic boundary currents of the Labrador Sea, Irminger Sea, and Newfoundland basin.},

It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

However, despite the identiﬁcation of relationships between SAM and Australia’s hydroclimate using certain data sets, and focussed on certain time periods, the association has not been extensively explored and signiﬁcant uncertainties remain. One reason for this is the existence of numerous indices, methods and data sets by which SAM has been approximated. In this paper, the various SAM deﬁnitions and indices are reviewed and the similarities and discrepancies are discussed, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each index development approach. Further, the sensitivity of the relationship between SAM and Australian rainfall to choice of SAM index is quantiﬁed and recommendations are given as to the most appropriate index to use when assessing the impacts of the SAM on Australia’s hydroclimate.

Recent climatological studies have also revealed multi-decadal variability in the modulation of the magnitude of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts. In this paper, the variability of flood risk across NSW is analysed with respect to the observed modulation of ENSO event magnitude. This is achieved through the use of a simple index of regional flood risk. The results indicate that cold ENSO events (La Niña) are the dominant drivers of elevated flood risk. An analysis of multi-decadal modulation of flood risk is achieved using the inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) index. The analysis reveals that IPO modulation of ENSO events leads to multi-decadal epochs of elevated flood risk, however this modulation appears to affect not only the magnitude of individual ENSO events, but also the frequency of their occurrence. This dual modulation of ENSO processes has the effect of reducing and elevating flood risk on multi-decadal timescales. These results have marked implications for achieving robust flood frequency analysis as well as providing a strong example of the role of natural climate variability.},

Here we report the largest Southern Hemisphere network of annually resolved tree ring fire histories, consisting of 1,767 fire-scarred trees from 97 sites (from 22 °S to 54 °S) in southern South America (SAS), to quantify the coupling of SAM and regional wildfire variability using recently created multicentury proxy indices of SAM for the years 1531–2010 AD. We show that at interannual time scales, as well as at multidecadal time scales across 37–54 °S, latitudinal gradient elevated wildfire activity is synchronous with positive phases of the SAM over the years 1665–1995. Positive phases of the SAM are associated primarily with warm conditions in these biomass-rich forests, in which widespread fire activity depends on fuel desiccation. Climate modeling studies indicate that greenhouse gases will force SAM into its positive phase even if stratospheric ozone returns to normal levels, so that climate conditions conducive to widespread fire activity in SAS will continue throughout the 21st century.},

	abstract = {Variability in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has global impacts on seasonal temperatures and rainfall. Current detection methods for extreme phases, which occur with irregular periodicity, rely upon sea surface temperature anomalies within a strictly defined geographic region of the Pacific Ocean. However, under changing climate conditions and ocean warming, these historically motivated indicators may not be reliable into the future. In this work, we demonstrate the power of data clustering as a robust, automatic way to detect anomalies in climate patterns. Ocean temperature profiles from Argo floats are partitioned into similar groups utilizing unsupervised machine learning methods. The automatically identified groups of measurements represent spatially coherent, large-scale water masses in the Pacific, despite no inclusion of geospatial information in the clustering task. Further, spatiotemporal dynamics of the clusters are strongly indicative of El Niño events, the east Pacific warming phase of ENSO. The fitting of a cluster model on a collection of ocean profiles identifies changes in the vertical structure of the temperature profiles through reassignment to a different group, concisely capturing physical changes to the water column during an El Niño event, such as thermocline tilting. Clustering proves to be an effective tool for analysis of the irregularly sampled (in space and time) data from Argo floats and may serve as a novel approach for detecting anomalies given the freedom from thresholding decisions. Unsupervised machine learning could be particularly valuable due to its ability to identify patterns in data sets without user-imposed expectations, facilitating further discovery of anomaly indicators.},

	abstract = {The Weddell Gyre (WG) is one of the main oceanographic features of the Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which plays an inﬂuential role in global ocean circulation as well as gas exchange with the atmosphere. We review the state‐of‐the art knowledge concerning the WG from an interdisciplinary perspective, uncovering critical aspects needed to understand this system's role in shaping the future evolution of oceanic heat and carbon uptake over the next decades. The main limitations in our knowledge are related to the conditions in this extreme and remote environment, where the polar night, very low air temperatures, and presence of sea ice year‐round hamper ﬁeld and remotely sensed measurements. We highlight the importance of winter and under‐ice conditions in the southern WG, the role that new technology will play to overcome present‐day sampling limitations, the importance of the WG connectivity to the low‐latitude oceans and atmosphere, and the expected intensiﬁcation of the WG circulation as the westerly winds intensify. Greater international cooperation is needed to deﬁne key sampling locations that can be visited by any research vessel in the region. Existing transects sampled since the 1980s along the Prime Meridian and along an East‐West section at {\textasciitilde}62°S should be maintained with regularity to provide answers to the relevant questions. This approach will provide long‐term data to determine trends and will improve representation of processes for regional, Antarctic‐wide, and global modeling efforts—thereby enhancing predictions of the WG in global ocean circulation and climate. Plain Language Summary The Weddell Gyre is one of the main oceanographic features in the ocean surrounding Antarctica, the Southern Ocean. Although located far from other continents, this polar region affects the planet through the exchange of gases between frigid ocean waters and the atmosphere, regulating oxygen and carbon dioxide farther north. Studying the Weddell Gyre is challenging, as sea ice covers the ocean surface year around, restricting access by research ships and sensing of ocean surface from satellites. New technology is now available to avoid past limitations, autonomous underwater vehicles, instruments ﬂown by planes, and ﬂoats instrumented with sea‐ice detection. Only through international collaboration can we obtain adequate data to populate environmental models and study key areas in the gyre or hot spots. In this review we identify the missing links in our knowledge of the gyre, proposing research to address those questions. Three aspects are critical to understanding the processes that drive the gyre's oceanography, ice, geology, chemistry, and biology: winter and under‐ice conditions that set the stage for the evolution of physics, ice, and biogeochemistry; exchange of water, material, and energy (or heat) with lower latitudes; and intensiﬁcation of the clockwise circulation of the gyre with changes in winds.},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing debate concerning the distribution of eddy stirring across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the nature of its controlling processes. The problem is addressed here by estimating the isentropic eddy diffusivity κ from a collection of hydrographic and altimetric observations, analyzed in a mixing length theoretical framework. It is shown that, typically, κ is suppressed by an order of magnitude in the upper kilometer of the ACC frontal jets relative to their surroundings, primarily as a result of a local reduction of the mixing length. This observation is reproduced by a quasi-geostrophic theory of eddy stirring across a broad barotropic jet based on the scaling law derived by Ferrari and Nikurashin (2010). The theory interprets the observed widespread suppression of the mixing length and κ in the upper layers of frontal jets as the kinematic consequence of eddy propagation relative to the mean flow within jet cores. Deviations from the prevalent regime of mixing suppression in the core of upper-ocean jets are encountered in a few special sites. Such ‘leaky jet’ segments appear to be associated with sharp stationary meanders of the mean flow that are generated by the interaction of the ACC with major topographic features. It is contended that the characteristic thermohaline structure of the Southern Ocean, consisting of multiple upper-ocean thermohaline fronts separated and underlaid by regions of homogenized properties, is largely a result of the widespread suppression of eddy stirring by parallel jets.},

	abstract = {We reexamine the relationship between circulation, bathymetry, and surface chlorophyll in the Southern Ocean, using new high-resolution maps of the frontal structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) derived from satellite altimetry. The maps reveal that the ACC consists of multiple filaments or jets. By averaging surface chlorophyll measurements along streamlines, we show that the fronts define the limits of zones with similar concentrations and seasonality of surface chlorophyll. The overall pattern of surface chlorophyll is consistent with strongest upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water south of the Polar Front (PF). However, the distribution of chlorophyll in the Southern Ocean is concentrated in a number of persistent blooms, observed downstream of islands and bathymetric features. In contrast to previous studies, we find little evidence that the fronts of the ACC are associated with enhanced productivity, at least where the fronts are distant from topography. Rather, we find that most regions of elevated chlorophyll in the open Southern Ocean can be explained by upwelling of nutrients (both macronutrients and micronutrients) where the ACC interacts with topography, followed by downstream advection. The upwelling is shown to be the consequence of the bottom pressure torque established by the large-scale flow, rather than being due to small-scale instabilities of the jets. The interaction of the flow with the topography therefore establishes both the large-scale dynamical balance of the ACC and determines the productivity of the open Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {We examine the synoptic variability of temperature and salinity in the Southern Ocean using a static gravest empirical mode (GEM) mapping based on historical hydrography and a time-evolving projection of the GEM created using satellite altimetry (satGEM). The GEM and satGEM projections allow the separation of observed trends into a component due to a shift of the circumpolar fronts (adiabatic) using the satGEM and a component due to changes in water masses (diabatic) expressed as a temporal trend in residual between historical hydrography and the static GEM. The mean southward movement of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) fronts drives an adiabatic warming of 1.196 ± 0.090 W m−2 distributed over most of the ACC and at all depths. This is strongest where the meridional temperature gradient is largest, such as in the upper 1000 dbar of the Subantarctic Front (SAF). There is a weak adiabatic freshening of 6.57 ± 0.18 mm yr−1 m−2, concentrated mainly below the Antarctic Intermediate Water and south of the SAF. Residuals between historical hydrography and the static GEM field, driven by diabatic changes in the water mass structure, have temporal trends in temperature and salinity. When these trends are integrated over the whole ACC there is a net cooling of −0.628 ± 0.129 W m−2 and strong freshening of 30.27 ± 0.70 mm yr−1 m−2. By combining the diabatic and adiabatic components and integrating over the ACC the net increase in heat and freshwater in the region is 0.570 ± 0.099 W m−2 and 36.91 ± 0.72 mm yr−1 m−2, respectively. The sum of the adiabatic and diabatic changes are consistent with previous trends inferred from observations.},

	abstract = {Most of the Southern Ocean is a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) area. There are exceptions to this situation downstream of some of the islands, where iron from the islands or surrounding shallow plateau fertilizes the mixed layer and causes a phytoplankton bloom in spring and summer. The main locations where this occurs are downstream of the South Georgia, Crozet, and Kerguelen islands. Data on mixed layer depths from Argo float profiles together with Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor chlorophyll a (chl a) and photosynthetically available radiation from these high-nutrient, high-chlorophyll (HNHC) areas are combined to study the effects of mixed layer-averaged light availability on phytoplankton concentrations in areas where iron limitation has been lifted. The results of this analysis are then transferred to HNLC areas to assess the potential importance of light limitation through the year. We conclude that light limitation does not significantly constrain the annual integrated standing stock of chl a in the HNLC Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {The surface waters of the Southern Ocean act as a control valve through which climatically important tracers such as heat, freshwater, and CO2 are transferred between the atmosphere and the ocean. The process that transports these tracers through the surface mixed layer into the ocean interior is known as ocean ventilation. Changes in ocean ventilation are thought to be important for both rapid transitions of the ocean’s global overturning circulation during the last deglaciation and the uptake and storage of excess heat and CO2 as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. I show how the interaction between Southern Ocean jets, topographic features, and ocean stratification can lead to rapid changes in Southern Ocean ventilation as a function of wind stress. For increasing winds, this interaction leads from a state in which tracers are confined to the surface mixed layer to a state in which tracers fill the ocean interior. For sufficiently high winds, the jet dynamics abruptly change, allowing the tracer to ventilate a water mass known as Antarctic Intermediate Water in the mid-depth Southern Ocean. Abrupt changes in Antarctic Intermediate Water ventilation have played a major role in rapid climate transitions in Earth’s past, and combined with the results presented here, this would suggest that jet dynamics could play a prominent role in contributing to, or even triggering, rapid transitions of the global climate system.
Jet dynamics play a crucial role in Southern Ocean ventilation.

In particular, we investigate the nutrient fronts that ring the subtropical gyres and propose that exchange across these fronts represents a critical pathway for nutrients to enter the gyres. However, these biogeochemical fronts most often coincide with dynamical fronts or jets, which are often considered barriers to exchange. Therefore, our view of ocean fronts as nutrient gateways must be reconciled with their tendency to act as barriers to exchange. Ekman transport is one mechanism that allows for nutrient transport across the surface of the fronts and is shown to be a leading term in the subtropical nutrient budgets. Ring formation and mixing beneath the core of jets are other mechanisms that can mediate cross-frontal exchange and have intriguing implications for nutrient budgets and their variability.},

Here skewness of sea level anomaly (SLA) from 1992 to 2013 is coupled with a meandering Gaussian jetw model to estimate the mean position, meridional width, and the percent variance that each front contributes to total SLA variability. The SAF and PF have comparable widths (85 km) in the circumpolar average, but their widths differ significantly in the East Pacific Basin (85 and 60 km, respectively). Interannual variability in the positions of the SAF and PF are also estimated using annual subsets of the SLA data from 1993 to 2012. The PF position has enhanced variability near strong topographic features such as the Kerguelen Plateau, the Campbell Plateau east of New Zealand, and downstream of Drake Passage. Neither the SAF nor the PF showed a robust meridional trend over the 20 year period. The Southern Annular Mode was significantly correlated with basin-averaged SAF and PF positions in the East Pacific and with the PF south of Australia. A correlation between the PF and the basin-scale wind stress curl anomaly was also found in the western extratropical Pacific but not in other basins.},

	abstract = {The location of fronts has a direct influence on both the physical and biological processes in the Southern Ocean. Here we explore the relative importance of bottom topography and winds for the location of Southern Ocean fronts, using 100 years of a control and climate change simulation from the high resolution coupled climate model HiGEM. Topography has primary control on the number and intensity of fronts at each longitude. However, there is no strong relationship between the position or spacing of jets and underlying topographic gradients because of the effects of upstream and downstream topography. The Southern Hemisphere Westerlies intensify and shift south by 1.3° in the climate change simulation, but there is no comparable meridional displacement of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current's (ACC) path or the fronts within its boundaries, even over flat topography. Instead, the current contracts meridionally and weakens. North of the ACC, the Subtropical Front (STF) shifts south gradually, even over steep topographic ridges. We suggest the STF reacts more strongly to the wind shift because it is strongly surface intensified. In contrast, fronts within the ACC are more barotropic and are therefore more sensitive to the underlying topography. An assessment of different methods for identifying jets reveals that maxima of gradients in the sea surface height field are the most reliable. Approximating the position of fronts using sea surface temperature gradients is ineffective at high latitudes while using sea surface height contours can give misleading results when studying the temporal variability of front locations.},

	abstract = {In Part 1 of this study, we showed that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) consisted of multiple fronts, each of which was consistently associated with a particular contour of sea surface height (SSH) or approximate streamline. In Part 2 we have used maps of SSH to examine the variability of the ACC fronts between 1992 and 2007. The SSH label associated with each frontal branch is nearly constant around the circumpolar belt. The front labels are also nearly constant in time: the bands of enhanced SSH gradient (i.e., fronts) occur along the same streamlines throughout the 15 year period of observations. Both short- and long-period changes of the SSH frontal labels of the ACC are small. Based on a tight relationship between dynamic height and cumulative baroclinic transport of the ACC, the baroclinic transport variability of the individual branches of the ACC is also expected to be small. The major change in the total ACC baroclinic transport occurs in the Drake Passage. The streamline associated with the northern branch of the SAF (SAF-N) does not pass through Drake Passage and the waters carried by this branch are not observed there. Instead, the transport of the SAF-N turns north in the Pacific to supply the export of water to the Indian Ocean north and south of Australia. Strong eddy activity in the southeast Pacific acts to dissipate the hydrographic signature of the SAF-N there. In the Atlantic, the SAF-N reappears as the same streamline is again associated with enhanced SSH gradients to the east of the Brazil – Malvinas confluence zone. While the large changes in SSH have occurred in the Southern Ocean between 1992 and 2007, there are strong regional differences. Because the ACC fronts are robustly associated with particular SSH contours, the changes in SSH reflect shifts in the position of the ACC fronts. In the circumpolar average, each of the ACC fronts has shifted to the south by about 60 km. The changes in SSH in the Southern Ocean are largely due to changes in ocean circulation, rather than warming and freshening by atmospheric fluxes. Much larger changes in SSH are observed in some locations of the Southern Ocean, particularly where the fronts interact with large-scale topography. The northern branch of the PF (PF-N) near the Kerguelen Plateau is an extreme example, where the PF-N followed a path around the northern end of Kerguelen Plateau between 1992 and 1997, passed through the Fawn Trough after 2003, and oscillated between the two paths between 1997 and 2003.},

	abstract = {The capacity of deep velocity estimates provided by the Argo float array to reconstruct both mean and eddying quantities, such as the heat flux, is addressed using an idealized eddy resolving numerical model, designed to be representative of the Southern Ocean. The model is seeded with 450 “virtual” Argo floats, which are then advected by the model fields for 10 years. The role of temporal sampling, array density and length of the float experiment are then systematically investigated by comparing the reconstructed velocity, eddy kinetic energy and heat-flux from the virtual Argo floats with the “true” values from the model output. We find that although errors in all three quantities decrease with increasing temporal sampling rate, number of floats and experiment duration, the error approaches an asymptotic limit. Thus, as these parameters exceed this limit, only marginal reductions in the error are observed. The parameters of the real Argo array, when scaled to match those of the virtual Argo array, generally fall near to, or within, the asymptotic region. Using the numerical model, a method for the calculation of cross-stream heat-fluxes is demonstrated. This methodology is then applied to 5 years of Argo derived velocities using the ANDRO dataset of Ollitrault \& Rannou (2013) in order to estimate the eddy heat flux at 1000m depth across the Polar Front in the Southern Ocean. The heat-flux is concentrated in regions downstream of large bathymetric features, consistent with the results of previous studies. 2 ± 0.5 TW of heat transport across the Polar Front at this depth is found, with more than 90\% of that total concentrated in less than 20\% of the total longitudes spanned by the front. Finally, the implications of this work for monitoring the ocean climate are discussed.},

We compare this with the position of jets in the mean flow indicated by regions of increased gradient in the mean sea surface temperature. The eddy force itself is not of primary importance; rather, the curl of that force affects the mean flow, so the irrotational force due to the gradient of eddy kinetic energy can be ignored, leaving a remainder that can be interpreted in terms of the eddy vorticity flux. Unlike previous modeling and altimetric studies, we find that the eddies act to decelerate some of the strongest jets and act as vorticity sources for others. The strongest jets are clearly not accelerated by eddies. A problem of interpretation does remain, however, since it is not clear how sea surface temperatures are related to the mean flow. This ambiguity can only be completely resolved by measurement of the mean flow, requiring a geoid that is accurate at length scales of order 100 km.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.166011},
	abstract = {This is a discussion of concentrated large-scale flows in planetary atmospheres and oceans, argued from the viewpoint of basic geophysical fluid dynamics. We give several elementary examples in which these flows form jets on rotating spheres. Jet formation occurs under a variety of circumstances: when flows driven by external stress have a rigid boundary which can balance the Coriolis force, and at which further concentration can be caused by the beta effect; when there are singular lines like the line of vanishing windstress or windstress-curl, or the Equator; when compact sources of momentum, heat or mass radiate jet-like beta plumes along latitude circles; when random external stirring of the fluid becomes organized by the beta effect into jets; when internal instability of the mass field generates zonal flow which then is concentrated into jets; when bottom topographic obstacles radiate jets, and when frontogenesis leads to shallow jet formation. Essential to the process of jet formation in stratified fluids is the baroclinic life cycle described in geostrophic turbulence studies; there, conversion from potential to kinetic energy generates eddy motions, and these convert to quasibarotropic motions which then radiate and induce jet-like large-scale circulation. Ideas of potential vorticity stirring by eddies generalize the notion of Rossby-wave radiation, showing how jets embedded in an ambient potential vorticity gradient (typically due to the spherical geometry of the rotating planet) gain eastward momentum while promoting broader, weaker westward circulation. Homogenization of potential vorticity is an important limit point, which many geophysical circulations achieve. This well-mixed state is found in subdomains of the terrestrial midlatitude oceans, the high-latitude circumpolar ocean, and episodically in the middle atmosphere. Homogenization expels potential vorticity gradients vertically to the top and bottom of the fluid, and sideways to the edges of flow domains or gyres; in both these ways is jet formation enhanced.},

While several PF studies have used gradient maxima in sea surface temperature (SST) or height to define its location, results from this study are based on a PF defined using SST measurements that avoid cloud contamination and the influence of steric sea level change. With a few regional exceptions, we find that the latitudinal position of the PF does not vary seasonally, yet its temperature exhibits a clear seasonal cycle. Consistent with previous studies, the position and intensity of the PF is largely influenced by bathymetry; generally, over steep topography, we find that the front intensifies and interannual variability in its position is low. We also investigate drivers of PF variability in the context of large-scale climate variability on various spatial and temporal scales, but find that the major modes of Southern Hemisphere climate variability explain only a tiny fraction of the interannual PF variance. Over the study time period, the PF intensifies at nearly all longitudes while exhibiting no discernible meridional displacement in its zonal mean path.},

	abstract = {The probability density functions (PDFs) of sea level and geostrophic relative vorticity are examined using satellite altimeter data. It is shown that departures from a Gaussian distribution can generally be represented by two functions, and that the spatial distribution of these two functions is closely linked to the skewness and kurtosis of the PDF. The patterns indicate that strong jets tend to be identified by a zero contour in skewness coinciding with a low value of kurtosis. A simple model of the statistics of a meandering frontal region is presented which reproduces these features. Comparisons with mean currents and sea surface temperature gradients confirm the identification of these features as jets, and confirm the existence of several Southern Ocean jets unresolved by drifter data. Diagnostics from a range of idealized eddying model simulations show that there is a strong, simple relationship between kurtosis of potential vorticity and effective diffusivity. This suggests that kurtosis may provide a simple method of mapping mixing barriers in the ocean.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the filamented nature of the jets associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). However, the nature, variability and continuity of the ACC fronts remain a topic of debate, in part because different methods provide different perspectives on this complex current system. The goal of this study is to identify a circumpolar coordinate system or reference frame that accounts for the multiple jets of the ACC and that would be suitable for future studies of cross-front fluxes. A new methodology is developed and tested using simulations from several ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). The method uses subsurface temperature criteria and transport maxima to identify five primary circumpolar fronts. The frontal structure derived using this approach is compared to the sea surface height (SSH) contour approach of Sokolov and Rintoul (2007) and a hybrid of the two methods is proposed. Strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches are summarized. We show that the hybrid approach defines a coordinate system that helps explain the circumpolar structure and variability of the ACC fronts and is relevant for the estimation of cross-front fluxes. Fronts defined in this way show behaviour largely consistent with previous studies, including along-front changes in intensity, splitting and merging of fronts, large meridional displacements and unstable behaviour in the vicinity of large bathymetric features.},

	abstract = {The major fronts between Tasmania and Antarctica are described on the basis of repeat hydrographic and expendable bathythermograph (XBT) sections and satellite altimetry. The high spatial and temporal resolution allows the location, structure and variability of the fronts to be investigated in detail. A large number of criteria are examined in an effort to identify reliable indicators of the fronts (e.g. lateral gradients along isobars and isopycnals, transport maxima, and the latitude where a property isoline crosses a particular isobar). The location of the Subtropical Front (STF) varies by less than 1° from its mean latitude of 45.2°S between the Tasmanian continental slope and the South Tasman Rise. The high resolution sections resolve multiple branches or filaments of each of the main fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) south of Australia: the Subantarctic Front (SAF) has two cores at mean latitudes of 50.5° and 52°S, the Polar Front (PF) has two branches which are found between 53° and 54°S and between 59° and 60°S, and the southern ACC front crosses the section near 62°S and 64°S. The southern boundary of the ACC sometimes merges with the southern ACC front (SACCF). The Antarctic Slope Front is found over the upper continental slope on those sections, which extend sufficiently close to Antarctica. Each of the frontal filaments identified on the repeat sections corresponds to a narrow range of sea surface height (SSH) values. These SSH streamlines are also found to correspond to large lateral gradients of SSH (i.e. fronts) east and west of the repeat section. Maps of sea surface height are then used to determine the path and variability of the fronts. The maps confirm the multi-filament structure of the fronts and show that streamlines merge and split along the path of the fronts. Each of the ACC fronts extends throughout the water column; as a result, the path of the fronts and the width of their meander envelopes are strongly influenced by bathymetry. Meridional displacements of the fronts are correlated with variations in SST, suggesting shifts of the fronts contribute to SST variability observed on interannual time scales.},

In practice, all such methods reduce, on the computer, to forms of least-squares. The global oceanographic problem is at the present time focussed primarily on smoothing, rather than forecasting, and the data types are unlike meteorological ones. As formulated in the consortium Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), an automatic differentiation tool is used to calculate the so-called adjoint code of the GCM, and the method of Lagrange multipliers used to render the problem one of unconstrained least-squares minimization. Major problems today lie less with the numerical algorithms (least-squares problems can be solved by many means) than with the issues of data and model error. Results of ongoing calculations covering the period of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and including among other data, satellite altimetry from TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason-1, ERS- 1/2, ENVISAT, and GFO, a global array of profiling floats from the Argo program, and satellite gravity data from the GRACE mission, suggest that the solutions are now useful for scientific purposes. Both methodology and applications are developing in a number of different directions.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional oceanic state is estimated for the period 1992–1997 as it results from combining large-scale ocean data sets with a general circulation model. At the cost of increased computational load, the estimation (assimilation) method is chosen specifically so that the resulting state estimate is consistent with the model equations, having no artificial sources or sinks. To bring the model into close agreement with observations, its initial temperature and salinity conditions are permitted to change, as are the time-dependent surface fluxes of momentum, heat and freshwater. Resulting changes of these “control vectors” are largely consistent with accepted uncertainties in the hydrographic climatology and meteorological analyses. The assimilation procedure is able to correct for many of the traditional shortcomings of the flow field by changing the surface boundary conditions. Changes in the resulting flow field are predominantly on the gyre scale and affect many features that are often poorly simulated in traditional numerical simulations, such as the strengths of the Gulf Stream and its extension, the Azores Current and the anticyclonic circulation associated with the Labrador Sea. Tests of the results and their consistency with prior error assumptions show that the constrained model has moved considerably closer to the observations imposed as constraints, but has also moved closer to independent data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment not used in the assimilation procedure. In some regions where the comparisons remain indeterminate, not enough ocean observations are available, and it is difficult to ascribe the residuals to either the model or the observations. Although problems remain, a useful first solution to the global time-dependent ocean state estimation problem has been found. The estimates will continue to improve through the evolution of numerical models, computer power increases, more data, and more efficient estimation methods.},

	abstract = {Annual and monthly mean values of continental freshwater discharge into the oceans are estimated at 1° resolution using several methods. The most accurate estimate is based on streamflow data from the world's largest 921 rivers, supplemented with estimates of discharge from unmonitored areas based on the ratios of runoff and drainage area between the unmonitored and monitored regions. Simulations using a river transport model (RTM) forced by a runoff field were used to derive the river mouth outflow from the farthest downstream gauge records. Separate estimates are also made using RTM simulations forced by three different runoff fields: 1) based on observed streamflow and a water balance model, and from estimates of precipitation P minus evaporation E computed as residuals from the atmospheric moisture budget using atmospheric reanalyses from 2) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) and 3) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with previous estimates, improvements are made in extending observed discharge downstream to the river mouth, in accounting for the unmonitored streamflow, in discharging runoff at correct locations, and in providing an annual cycle of continental discharge. The use of river mouth outflow increases the global continental discharge by ∼19\% compared with unadjusted streamflow from the farthest downstream stations. The river-based estimate of global continental discharge presented here is 37 288 ± 662 km3 yr−1, which is ∼7.6\% of global P or 35\% of terrestrial P. While this number is comparable to earlier estimates, its partitioning into individual oceans and its latitudinal distribution differ from earlier studies. The peak discharges into the Arctic, the Pacific, and global oceans occur in June, versus May for the Atlantic and August for the Indian Oceans. Snow accumulation and melt are shown to have large effects on the annual cycle of discharge into all ocean basins except for the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The discharge and its latitudinal distribution implied by the observation-based runoff and the ECMWF reanalysis-based P–E agree well with the river-based estimates, whereas the discharge implied by the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis-based P–E has a negative bias.},

A solution to the design problem is presented here in terms of optimal observations that emerge as singular vectors of the modiﬁed data resolution matrix. The actual computation is feasible only for scalar quantities and in the limit of large observational errors. Identical twin experiments performed in the framework of a 1Њ North Atlantic primitive equation model demonstrate that such optimal observations, when applied to determining the heat transport across the Greenland–Scotland ridge, perform signiﬁcantly better than traditional section data. On seasonal to interannual time scales, optimal observations are located primarily along the continental shelf and information about heat transport, wind stress, and stratiﬁcation is being communicated through boundary waves and advective processes. On time scales of about 1 month, sea surface height observations appear to be more efﬁcient in reconstructing the cross-ridge heat transport than hydrographic observations. Optimal observations also provide a tool for understanding changes of ocean state associated with anomalies of integral quantities such as meridional heat transport.},

	abstract = {The climate over Europe is signiﬁcantly affected by the state of the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic, which in turn is inﬂuenced by various slowly varying components of the climate system. Linear models are employed to investigate how much of the European winter air temperature variability can directly be predicted from the sea surface temperature. By comparing relations from a statistical model to those from an adjoint to a linearized climate model we evaluate the ability of the lagged maximum covariance analysis to reconstruct the dynamical relation between sea surface temperature (SST) and atmosphere temperature. Applied to speciﬁc SST conditions, both approaches allow prediction of a similar and signiﬁcant fraction of the air temperature variability from SST. For a 1‐month lag, extreme air temperature responses are signiﬁcant and found to be associated with an omega‐blocking pattern over Scandinavia. Plain Language Summary A connection between sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric circulation anomalies has been established for decades. Certain SST anomalies force changes in the atmospheric circulation and cause over Europe typical weather patterns (dry and cold or wet and warm) after some lag. A relationship between the SST pattern and the associated response can be derived from numerical models or statistical relations and used for forecasting the atmospheric response to SST anomalies. In this paper, we validate this forecasting method with observational data.},

	abstract = {The observational network around the North Atlantic has improved significantly over the last few decades with subsurface profiling floats and satellite observations and the recent efforts to monitor the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). These have shown decadal time scale changes across the North Atlantic including in heat content, heat transport, and the circulation. However, there are still significant gaps in the observational coverage. Ocean reanalyses integrate the observations with a dynamically consistent ocean model and can be used to understand the observed changes. However, the ability of the reanalyses to represent the dynamics must also be assessed. We use an ensemble of global ocean reanalyses to examine the time mean state and interannual-decadal variability of the North Atlantic ocean since 1993. We assess how well the reanalyses are able to capture processes and whether any understanding can be gained. In particular, we examine aspects of the circulation including convection, AMOC and gyre strengths, and transports. We find that reanalyses show some consistency, in particular showing a weakening of the subpolar gyre and AMOC at 50◦N from the mid-1990s until at least 2009 (related to decadal variability in previous studies), a strengthening and then weakening of the AMOC at 26.5◦N since 2000, and impacts of circulation changes on transports. These results agree with model studies and the AMOC observations at 26.5◦N since 2005. We also see less spread across the ensemble in AMOC strength and mixed layer depth, suggesting improvements as the observational coverage has improved.},

Combining in‐situ observations with remote sensing and atmospheric reanalysis data, we show that increased freshening of the subpolar region gives rise to a faster surface cooling in fall and winter. Large freshwater events, in particular, result in pronounced cold anomalies with sharp temperature gradients that promote an enhanced storminess. The storms reinforce the cooling by driving stronger heat losses and modulating the surface ﬂow. Consistent with this mechanism, past freshwater events have been followed by cold anomalies in winter of approximately −2°C and increases in the North Atlantic Oscillation index of up to ∼0.6 within 3 years. We expect that future freshwater discharges into the North Atlantic will amplify the cold anomaly and trigger an enhanced wintertime storminess with far‐reaching climatic implications. Plain Language Summary Recent winters have been unique due to a rapid and extreme cooling of the subpolar North Atlantic. Combining ocean and atmospheric data, we show that increased freshwater in this region leads to shallower surface layers that adjust faster to the lower air temperature in fall and winter. The faster surface cooling increases the south‐north temperature gradient, which promotes the development of storms. The storms, in turn, reinforce the cooling by modulating the surface ﬂow. Accordingly, past freshwater events have been followed by an extremely cold ocean surface in the subpolar North Atlantic in winter and major changes in large‐scale weather patterns. We expect that future freshwater discharges from Greenland and the Arctic will amplify the cooling and trigger an enhanced wintertime storminess with far‐reaching implications for the climate.},

Salinity contributions to sea surface height variability appear more significant at low latitudes than expected, possibly resulting from advective and diffusive processes. Results are generally consistent with altimetric variability under two simple kinematic hypotheses, and much of the observed structure coincides with known dynamical features. A large fraction of the sea surface height variability is consistent with the hypothesis of dominance of the first baroclinic mode.},

Over a hundred eco-provinces are identified with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Using a connectivity graph with ecological dissimilarity as the distance metric, robust aggregated eco-provinces (AEPs) are objectively defined by nesting the eco-provinces. Using the AEPs, the control of nutrient supply rates on community structure is explored. Eco-provinces and AEPs are unique and aid model interpretation.

	abstract = {We use an unsupervised classiﬁcation technique (i.e. Gaussian mixture modeling or GMM) to identify ocean regions with similar balances between processes that determine the surface budget of dissolved inorganic carbon. GMM objectively locates sub-populations in the distribution of carbon budget terms. We use a simple four-class description and ﬁnd regimes that are broadly consistent with classical theoretical frameworks. Class 1 covers 24\% of ocean surface area and corresponds to highly productive areas with strong vertical mixing, wind-driven open ocean upwelling, and absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Class 2 covers 8\% of ocean surface area and corresponds to regions of especially weak productivity. Class 3 covers 16\% of ocean surface area and corresponds to wind-driven coastal and equatorial upwelling. Finally, class 4 covers the remaining 52\% of ocean surface area and corresponds to the relatively unproductive subtropical gyres, which are typically characterized by downwelling and low surface nutrient concentrations. We argue that GMM may be a useful method for comparing biogeochemical regimes between climate models.},

In the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) density class, a convergence of diapycnal volume fluxes leads to the formation and inflation of mixed layer waters during winter. A portion of this water is detrained into the pycnocline during early spring, when surface heating restratifies the deep winter mixed layer. The annually averaged subduction rate of SAMW shows pronounced interannual variability, partly controlled by the temporal tendency of the winter mixed layer depth from one year to the next. No significant correlation between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the isopycnally integrated SAMW subduction rate is apparent. However, Ekman downwelling/upwelling intensities modulated by the SAM influence interannual variations in the subduction rates of water masses lighter and heavier than SAMW with an opposing sign: during positive phases of the SAM, more pycnocline waters are entrained into the mixed layer and transformed into lighter densities within the Antarctic Intermediate Water density class, whereas more mixed layer waters are subducted into the pycnocline within the Subtropical Mode Water density class. Such distinct responses of upper Southern Ocean water masses to the SAM are qualitatively consistent with observational constraints. Based on a comparison between offline kinematic and thermodynamic diagnostics, we infer that diapycnal mixing within the mixed layer may contribute up to 50\% of the formation rate of SAMW on interannual timescales.},

	abstract = {Although they are key components of the surface ocean carbon budget, physical processes inducing carbon fluxes across the mixed-layer base, i.e., subduction and obduction, have received much less attention than biological processes. Using a global model analysis of the preindustrial ocean, physical carbon fluxes are quantified and compared to the other carbon fluxes in and out of the surface mixed layer, i.e., air-sea CO2gas exchange and sedimentation of biogenic material. Model-based carbon obduction and subduction are evaluated against independent data-based estimates to the extent that was possible. We find that climatological physical fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are two orders of magnitude larger than the other carbon fluxes and vary over the globe at smaller spatial scale. At temperate latitudes, the subduction of DIC and to a much lesser extent ({\textless}10\%) the sinking of particles maintain CO2undersaturation, whereas DIC is obducted back to the surface in the tropical band (75\%) and Southern Ocean (25\%). At the global scale, these two large counter-balancing fluxes of DIC amount to +275.5 PgC yr−1 for the supply by obduction and −264.5 PgC yr−1 for the removal by subduction which is ∼ 3 to 5 times larger than previous estimates. Moreover, we find that subduction of organic carbon (dissolved and particulate) represents ∼ 20\% of the total export of organic carbon: at the global scale, we evaluate that of the 11 PgC yr−1 of organic material lost from the surface every year, 2.1 PgC yr−1 is lost through subduction of organic carbon. Our results emphasize the strong sensitivity of the oceanic carbon cycle to changes in mixed-layer depth, ocean currents, and wind.},

It was found that the subduction rate of the global ocean could be significantly reduced under a warming climate, as compared to a simulation of the present-day climate. The reduction in the subduction volume was quantitatively estimated at about 40 Sv and was found to be primarily induced by the decreasing of the lateral induction term due to a shallower winter mixed layer depth. The shrinking of the winter mixed layer would result from intensified stratification caused by increased heat input into the ocean under a warming climate. A reduction in subduction associated with the vertical pumping term was estimated at about 5 Sv. Further, in the Southern Ocean, a significant reduction in subduction was estimated at around 24 Sv, indicating a substantial contribution to the weakening of global subduction.},

Focus is on contribution of eddies to the subduction process. To separate the subduction rate into contributions by eddies and mean flows, the temporal residual mean (TRM) velocity is used. In the mean subduction rate, lateral induction caused by the strong eastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is dominant. The largest rate is located in the Drake Passage. The estimated eddy-induced subduction rate is comparable with the mean subduction rate, and it tends to cancel the vertical mean component in many regions. In the west of the Drake Passage, however, the eddy-induced subduction is larger than the vertical mean component, and this eddy-induced subduction was not detected in previous studies using the thickness diffusion parameterization and an eddy-permitting model. Results of idealized sensitivity studies to model resolution suggest that the subduction rate would be larger using a model with higher vertical resolution. Therefore, the vertical resolution should be paid more attention in model studies investigating eddy-induced subduction, and not just the horizontal resolution.},

In this paper, a series of offline-nested numerical simulations is used to study submesoscale flow in the Drake Passage and Scotia Sea regions of the Southern Ocean. These simulations are initialized from an ocean state estimate for late April 2015, with the intent to simulate features observed during the Surface Mixed Layer at Submesoscales (SMILES) research cruise, which occurred at that time and location. The nested models are downscaled from the original state estimate resolution of 1/12° and grid spacing of about 8 km, culminating in a submesoscale-resolving model with a resolution of 1/192° and grid spacing of about 500 m. The submesoscale eddy field is found to be highly spatially variable, with pronounced hot spots of submesoscale activity. These areas of high submesoscale activity correspond to a significant difference in the 30-day average mixed layer depth  between the 1/12° and 1/192° simulations. Regions of large vertical velocities in the mixed layer correspond with high mesoscale strain rather than large . It is found that  is well correlated with the mesoscale density gradient but weakly correlated with both the mesoscale kinetic energy and strain. This has implications for the development of submesoscale eddy parameterizations that are sensitive to the character of the large-scale flow.},

	abstract = {The annual rate at which mixed-layer fluid is transferred into the permanent thermocline—that is, the annual subduction rate Sann and the effective subduction period 𝒯eff—is inferred from climatological data in the North Atlantic. From its kinematic definition, Sann is obtained by summing the vertical velocity at the base of the winter mixed layer with the lateral induction of fluid through the sloping base of the winter mixed layer. Geostrophic velocity fields, computed from the Levitus climatology assuming a level of no motion at 2.5 km, are used; the vertical velocity at the base of the mixed layer is deduced from observed surface Ekman pumping velocities and linear vorticity balance. A plausible pattern of Sann is obtained with subduction rates over the subtropical gyre approaching 100 m/yr—twice the maximum rate of Ekman pumping. The subduction period 𝒯eff is found by viewing subduction as a transformation process converting mixed-layer fluid into stratified thermocline fluid. The effective period is that period of time during the shallowing of the mixed layer in which sufficient buoyancy is delivered to permit irreversible transfer of fluid into the main thermocline at the rate Sann. Typically 𝒯eff is found to be 1 to 2 months over the major part of the subtropical gyre, rising to 4 months in the tropics. Finally, the heat budget of a column of fluid, extending from the surface down to the base of the seasonal thermocline is discussed, following it over an annual cycle. We are able to relate the buoyancy delivered to the mixed layer during the subduction period to the annual-mean buoyancy forcing through the sea surface plus the warming due to the convergence of Ekman heat fluxes. The relative importance of surface fluxes (heat and freshwater) and Ekman fluxes in supplying buoyancy to support subduction is examined using the climatologist observations of Isemer and Hasse, Schmitt et al., and Levitus. The pumping down of fluid from the warm summer Ekman layer into the thermocline makes a crucial contribution and, over the subtropical gyre, is the dominant term in the thermodynamics of subduction.},

	abstract = {Subduction processes in the Southern Ocean transfer oxygen, heat, and anthropogenic carbon into the ocean interior. The future response of upper-ocean subduction, in the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) classes, is dependent on the evolution of the combined surface buoyancy forcing and overlying westerly wind stress. Here, the recently observed pattern of a poleward intensification of the westerly winds is divided into its shift and increase components. SAMW and AAIW formation occurs in regional “hot spots” in deep mixed layer zones, primarily in the southeast Indian and Pacific. It is found that the mixed layer depth responds differently to wind stress perturbations across these regional formation zones. An increase only in the westerly winds in the Indian sector steepens isopycnals and increases the local circulation, driving deeper mixed layers and increased subduction. Conversely, in the same region, a poleward shift and poleward intensification of the westerly winds reduces heat loss and increases freshwater input, thus decreasing the mixed layer depth and consequently the associated SAMW and AAIW subduction. In the Pacific sector, all wind stress perturbations lead to increases in heat loss and decreases in freshwater input, resulting in a net increase in SAMW and AAIW subduction. Overall, the poleward shift in the westerly wind stress dominates the SAMW subduction changes, rather than the increase in wind stress. The net decrease in SAMW subduction across all basins would likely decrease anthropogenic carbon sequestration; however, the net AAIW subduction changes across the Southern Ocean are overall minor.},

	abstract = {An initially resting ocean of stratification N is considered, subject to buoyancy loss at its surface of magnitude B-0 over a circular region of radius r, at a latitude where the Coriolis parameter is f. Initially the buoyancy loss gives rise to upright convection as an ensemble of plumes penetrates the stratified ocean creating a vertically mixed layer. However, as deepening proceeds, horizontal density gradients at the edge of the forcing region support a geostrophic rim current, which develops growing meanders through baroclinic instability. Eventually finite-amplitude baroclinic eddies sweep stratified water into the convective region at the surface and transport convected water outward and away below, setting up a steady state in which lateral buoyancy flux offsets buoyancy loss at the surface. In this final state quasi-horizontal baroclinic eddy transfer dominates upright `'plume” convection. By using `'parcel theory” to consider the energy transformations taking place, it is shown that the depth, h(final), at which deepening by convective plumes is arrested by lateral buoyancy flux due to baroclinic eddies, and the time t(final) it takes to reach this depth, is given by h(final) = gamma (B(0)r)(1/3)/N, t(final) = beta (r(2)/B-0)(1/3), both independent of rotation. Here gamma and beta are dimensionless constants that depend on the efficiency of baroclinic eddy transfer. A number of laboratory and numerical experiments are then inspected and carried out to seek confirmation of these parameter dependencies and obtain quantitative estimates of the constants. It is found that gamma = 3.9 +/- 0.9 and beta = 12 +/- 3. Finally, the implications of our study to the understanding of integral properties of deep and intermediate convection in the ocean are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean features ventilation pathways that transport surface waters into the subsurface thermocline on time scales from decades to centuries, sequestering anomalies of heat and carbon away from the atmosphere and thereby regulating the rate of surface warming. Despite its importance for climate sensitivity, the factors that control the distribution of heat along these pathways are not well understood. In this study, we use an observationally constrained, physically consistent global ocean model to examine the sensitivity of heat distribution in the recently ventilated subsurface Paciﬁc (RVP) sector of the Southern Ocean to changes in ocean temperature and salinity. First, we deﬁne the RVP using numerical passive tracer release experiments that highlight the ventilation pathways. Next, we use an ensemble of adjoint sensitivity experiments to quantify the sensitivity of the RVP heat content to changes in ocean temperature and salinity. In terms of sensitivities to surface ocean properties, we ﬁnd that RVP heat content is most sensitive to anomalies along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), upstream of the subduction hotspots. In terms of sensitivities to subsurface ocean properties, we ﬁnd that RVP heat content is most sensitive to basin-scale changes in the subtropical Paciﬁc Ocean, around the same latitudes as the RVP. Despite the localized nature of mode water subduction hotspots, changes in basin-scale density gradients are an important controlling factor on heat distribution in the southeast Paciﬁc.},

	abstract = {Subduction, water mass transformation, and transport rates in the Indo-Pacific Ocean are diagnosed in a recent version of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis coupled model. It is found that the subduction across the base of the winter mixed layer is dominated by the lateral transfer, particularly within the relatively dense water classes corresponding to the densest mode and intermediate waters. However, within lighter densities, including those characterizing the lighter varieties of mode waters, the vertical transfer has a strong positive input to the net subduction. The upper-ocean volume transports across 30 degrees N and 32 degrees S are largest within the density classes that correspond to mode waters. In the North Pacific, the buoyancy flux converts the near-surface waters mostly to denser water classes, whereas in the Southern Ocean the surface waters are transformed both to lighter and denser water classes, depending on the density. In response to a doubling of CO2, the subduction, transformation, and transport of mode waters in both hemispheres shift to lighter densities but do not change significantly, whereas the subduction of intermediate waters decreases. The area of large winter mixed layer depths decreases, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. In the low latitudes, the thermocline water flux that enters the tropical Pacific via the western boundary flows generally increases. However, its anomaly has a complex structure, so that integrated estimates can be sensitive to the isopycnal ranges. The upper part of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) strengthens in the warmer climate, whereas its lower part weakens. The anomaly in the EUC closely follows the anomaly in stratification along the equator. The Indonesian Throughflow transport decreases with part of it being redirected eastward. This part joins with the intensified equatorward thermocline flows at the western boundaries and contributes to the EUC anomaly.},

	abstract = {In the Ocean, the seasonal cycle is the mode that couples climate forcing to ecosystem response in production, diversity and carbon export. A better characterisation of the ecosystem's seasonal cycle therefore addresses an important gap in our ability to estimate the sensitivity of the biological pump to climate change. In this study, the regional characteristics of the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean are examined in terms of the timing of the bloom initiation, its amplitude, regional scale variability and the importance of the climatological seasonal cycle in explaining the overall variance. The seasonal cycle was consequently defined into four broad zonal regions; the subtropical zone (STZ), the transition zone (TZ), the Antarctic circumpolar zone (ACZ) and the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Defining the Southern Ocean according to the characteristics of its seasonal cycle provides a more dynamic understanding of ocean productivity based on underlying physical drivers rather than climatological biomass. The response of the biology to the underlying physics of the different seasonal zones resulted in an additional classification of four regions based on the extent of inter-annual seasonal phase locking and the magnitude of the integrated seasonal biomass. This regionalisation contributes towards an improved understanding of the regional differences in the sensitivity of the Southern Oceans ecosystem to climate forcing, potentially allowing more robust predictions of the effects of long term climate trends.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin and fate of mode and intermediate waters (MW) in the subtropical Pacific Ocean is critical for climate, as MW store and export a large volume of CO2, heat, nutrients and salinity to lower latitudes at depths isolated from the atmosphere. A realistic 4D simulation has been used to track and quantify the MW routes and their property characteristics at the last region of subduction. It also allows us to quantify the water transformation after subduction. The simulation has been compared to available observations using a collocation method that interpolated model data onto observations in time and space. The comprehensive comparisons gave us confidence in the model's capacity to reproduce MW characteristics. A quantitative Lagrangian analysis was performed on the model output to depict the origin, the fate and the route of MW circulating in the southern Pacific Ocean, selected in the density range of 26.8-27.4 kg m(-3). We found 18 Sv of MW were transported northward in patches through the 42 degrees S section, mostly between 200 and 800 m depth. Of this transport, 8 Sv enters the Pacific Ocean in the upper layer south of Tasmania and subducts in the Pacific. The remainder is not ventilated in the Pacific sector: 4 Sv is advected from the Indian Ocean south of Tasmania at intermediate depth and finally 6 Sv is part of an intermediate depth recirculation within the Pacific Ocean. Particles take up to 30 years to travel northward through our domain before crossing the 42 degrees S section. Southward transport branches also exist: 3 Sv flows southward following the eastern New Zealand coast and then exits through Drake Passage. An additional 4 Sv passes southward in the Tasman Sea, following the eastern Tasmanian coast and enters the Indian Ocean south of Tasmania, as part of the Tasman Leakage. Four different formation sites have been identified, where the MW are last ventilated. These formation sites have different water masses with specific salinity ranges. A study on the evolution of the physical characteristics of each of these water masses has been performed. All MW characteristics become more homogeneous at 42 degrees S than they were when they left the mixed layer. This study confirms the homogenisation of mode waters at intermediate depth in the Pacific Ocean as previously revealed in the Indian Ocean using the same methodology. Transformations are shown to be mostly isopycnal in the Tasman Sea and diapycnal farther east.},

In this study, the authors use an idealized model to examine these two mechanisms by which eddies influence subduction and to discuss how eddy subduction may be better approximated using the concept of vertical transport streamfunction than the conventional meridional transport streamfunction.},

The reduction in the subduction volume was quantitatively estimated at about 40 Sv and was found to be primarily induced by the decreasing of the lateral induction term due to a shallower winter mixed layer depth. The shrinking of the winter mixed layer would result from intensified stratification caused by increased heat input into the ocean under a warming climate. A reduction in subduction associated with the vertical pumping term was estimated at about 5 Sv. Further, in the Southern Ocean, a significant reduction in subduction was estimated at around 24 Sv, indicating a substantial contribution to the weakening of global subduction.},

Yet, in the Southern Ocean the role of water masses in the uptake of anthropogenic carbon is still debated. Here, a methodology is applied that tracks the carbon flux of each Southern Ocean water mass in response to climate change. A global marine biogeochemical model was coupled to a climate model, making 140-yr Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)-type simulations, where atmospheric CO2 increased by 1\% yr(-1) to 4 times the preindustrial concentration (4 x CO2). Impacts of atmospheric CO2 (carbon-induced sensitivity) and climate change (climate-induced sensitivity) on the water mass carbon fluxes have been isolated performing two sensitivity simulations. In the first simulation, the atmospheric CO2 influences solely the marine carbon cycle, while in the second simulation, it influences both the marine carbon cycle and earth's climate. At 4 x CO2, the cumulative carbon uptake by the Southern Ocean reaches 278 PgC, 53\% of which is taken up by modal and intermediate water masses. The carbon-induced and climate-induced sensitivities vary significantly between the water masses. The carbon-induced sensitivities enhance the carbon uptake of the water masses, particularly for the denser classes. But, enhancement strongly depends on the water mass structure. The climate-induced sensitivities either strengthen or weaken the carbon uptake and are influenced by local processes through changes in CO2 solubility and stratification, and by large-scale changes in outcrop surface (OS) areas. Changes in OS areas account for 45\% of the climate-induced reduction in the Southern Ocean carbon uptake and are a key factor in understanding the future carbon uptake of the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {Evidence from physical and geochemical tracers measured during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) shows that there are four sub-types of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the South Pacific. The main formation region of AAIW is the southeast Pacific, where fresh, cold, high oxygen, low nutrient, intermediate waters are created. This AAIW is transported north and mixes with Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Waters (EqPIW), themselves a combination of AAIW and nutrient rich, old North Pacific deep waters. 'Tasman' AAIW found in the Coral and Tasman Seas is more saline and warmer than the main subtropical gyre, and appears to have formed from mixing of AAIW with thermocline waters in the Tasman Gyre. Tasman AAIW leaks out of the Tasman basin to the north of New Zealand and along Chatham Rise, and also in the South Tasman Sea via the Tasman Leakage. Another source of relatively fresh, high oxygen, low nutrient, young AAIW comes directly from the Southern Ocean, flowing into the southwest and central South Pacific Basin, west of the East Pacific Rise. This 'Southern Ocean' (SO) AAIW is most likely a mixture of AAIW formed locally at the Subantarctic Front (SAF), and AAIW formed along the SAF in the southeast Pacific or Indian oceans and transported by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Interpreting physical and geochemical tracers, combined with velocity estimates from Argo floats, and previous research, has allowed us to refine the detailed circulation pattern of AAIW in the South Pacific, especially in the topographically complex southwest Pacific.

This isopycnal range, which includes the densest Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) formed in this region, is mostly below the mixed layer, and so experiences little direct air-sea forcing. Data from two cruises in the southeast Pacific were examined for evidence of cross-frontal exchange; numerous eddies and intrusions containing Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) water were observed north of the SAF, as well as a fresh surface layer during the summer cruise that was likely due to Ekman transport. These features penetrated north of the SAF, even though the potential vorticity structure of the SAF should have acted as a barrier to exchange. An optimum multiparameter (OMP) analysis incorporating a range of observed properties was used to estimate the cumulative cross-frontal exchange. The OMP analysis revealed an along-front increase in PFZ water fractional content in the region north of the SAF between the 27.1 and 27.3kgm-3 isopycnals; the increase was approximately 0.13 for every 15 degrees of longitude. Between the 27.0 and 27.1kgm-3 isopycnals, the increase was approximately 0.15 for every 15 degrees of longitude. A simple bulk calculation revealed that this magnitude of cross-frontal exchange could have caused the downstream evolution of SAMW temperature and salinity properties observed by Argo profiling floats.},

At the mesoscale, significant correlations are observed between pCFC-11 anomaly, anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST), net heat flux, and mixed layer depth. An eddy-centric analysis of the simulated CFC-11 field suggests that anticyclonic warm-core eddies generate negative pCFC-11 anomalies and cyclonic cold-core eddies generate positive anomalies of pCFC-11. Surface pCFC-11 is modulated by mixed layer dynamics in addition to CFC-11 air-sea fluxes. A negative cross correlation between mixed layer depth and surface pCFC-11 anomalies is linked to higher CFC-11 uptake in anticyclones and lower CFC-11 uptake in cyclones, especially in winter. An almost exact asymmetry in the air-sea CFC-11 flux between cyclones and anticyclones is found.},

Virtual drifters are released in a regularly spaced pattern across the Southern Ocean at depths of 250, 500, and 1000 m during both summer and winter months. The drifters are advected along isopycnals for a period of 4 years, unless they outcrop into the mixed layer, where lateral advection and a parameterization of vertical mixing are applied. The focus of this study is on the discrete exchange between the model mixed layer and the interior. Localization of interior-mixed layer exchange occurs downstream of major topographic features across the Indian and Pacific basins, creating "hotspots" of outcropping. Minimal outcropping occurs in the Atlantic basin, while 59\% of drifters outcrop in the Pacific sector and in Drake Passage (the region from 140 degrees W to 40 degrees W), a disproportionately large amount even when considering the relative basin sizes. Due to spatial and temporal variations in mixed layer depth, the Lagrangian trajectories provide a statistical measure of mixed layer residence times. For each exchange into the mixed layer, the residence time has a Rayleigh distribution with a mean of 30 days; the cumulative residence time of the drifters is 261 +/- 194 days, over a period of 4 years. These results suggest that certain oceanic gas concentrations, such as CO2 and C-14, will likely not reach equilibrium with the atmosphere before being resubducted.},

The main focus is the representation of the present (1988-2007) mode and intermediate waters, thus framing an analysis of winter and summer mixed layer depths; temperature, salinity, and potential vorticity structure; and temporal variability of sea ice distributions. We also consider the interannual variability over the same 20 year period. Comparisons are made between models as well as to observation-based analyses where available. The CORE-II models exhibit several biases relative to Southern Ocean observations, including an underestimation of the model mean mixed layer depths of mode and intermediate water masses in March (associated with greater ocean surface heat gain), and an overestimation in September (associated with greater high latitude ocean heat loss and a more northward winter sea-ice extent). In addition, the models have cold and fresh/warm and salty water column biases centred near 50 degrees S. Over the 1933-2007 period, the CORE-II models consistently simulate spatially variable trends in sea-ice concentration, surface freshwater fluxes, mixed layer depths, and 200-700 in ocean heat content. In particular, sea-ice coverage around most of the Antarctic continental shelf is reduced, leading to a cooling and freshening of the near surface waters. The shoaling of the mixed layer is associated with increased surface buoyancy gain, except in the Pacific where sea ice is also influential. The models are in disagreement, despite the common CORE-II atmospheric state, in their spatial pattern of the 20-year trends in the mixed layer depth and sea-ice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonlinearities in the equation of state of seawater lead to water mass transformation due to cabbeling and thermobaricity. Here the contribution of cabbeling and thermobaricity to water mass transformation is calculated in a Neutral Density framework, using temperature gradients derived from observationally based gridded climatologies and observationally based estimates of the spatially varying eddy diffusivities. It is shown that cabbeling and thermobaricity play a significant role in the water mass transformation budget, with cabbeling having a particularly important role in the formation of Antarctic Intermediate Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. A physical hypothesis is presented which explains why cabbeling is important for Antarctic Intermediate Water formation. It is shown that spatially varying estimates of eddy diffusivities are essential to correctly quantify the role of cabbeling to the formation of Antarctic Intermediate Water.},

	abstract = {An estimate of Southern Ocean volume in temperature-salinity (T-S) classes is made with a focus on cold water masses south of the Polar Front, at depths shallower than 2,000 m. The volumetric diagram for waters below 5 degrees C shows a deficit at temperatures near 0 degrees C and 34.2 psu, surrounded by a ring of larger volumes, related to water mass formation near the Polar Front and near the continental margins as well as mixing effects. The cold, fresh extreme of the Antarctic Intermediate Water T-S relation shows a volumetric maximum, apparently distinct from the interior T-S relationship. We identify this mode as Antarctic Mode Water with a volumetric maximum centered near 2.0 degrees C and 33.9 psu. This maximum lies on a large-scale ridge of high volume representing the Antarctic Surface Water mixed layers south of the Polar Front, at the northern edge of the seasonal sea-ice cover. Additional maxima on the diagram near freezing temperatures seem to be related to processes operating on the slope and shelf, though the data coverage in these regions is much reduced. The origin of the Antarctic Mode Water is ultimately due to sea-ice melt, which systematically shifts the T-S relation of surface water to lower salinities, whereas its thickness and distribution is linked to circumpolar northward Ekman transport and the eddy fluxes of the Polar Front.},

Here we present calculations of vertical differences in oxygen and carbon isotopes (Delta delta O-18 and Delta delta C-13, respectively) from a depth transect of southwest Pacific Ocean sediment cores to reconstruct changes in water mass structure and CO2 storage. During the Last Glacial Maximum, Delta delta O-18 indicates a more homogenous deep Pacific below 1,100 m, whereas regional Delta delta C-13 elucidates greater sequestration of CO2 in two distinct layers: enhanced CO2 storage at intermediate depths between similar to 940 and 1,400 m, and significantly more CO2 at 1,600 m and below. This highlights an isolated glacial intermediate water mass and places the main geochemical divide at least 500 m shallower than the Holocene. During the initial stages of the deglaciation in Heinrich Stadial 1 (17.5-14.5 ka), restructuring of the upper similar to 2,000 m of the southwest Pacific water column coincided with sea-ice retreat and rapid CO2 release from intermediate depths, while CO2 release from the deep ocean was earlier and more gradual than waters above it. These changes suggest that sea-ice retreat and shifts in Southern Ocean frontal locations contributed to rapid CO2 ventilation from the Southern Ocean's intermediate depths and gradual ventilation from the deep ocean during the early deglaciation.},

	abstract = {Interannual variability of Ocean Heat Content (OHC) is intimately linked to ocean water mass changes. Water mass characteristics are imprinted at the ocean surface and are modulated by climate variability on interannual to decadal time scales. In this study, we investigate the water mass change and their variability using an isopycnal decomposition of the OHC. For that purpose, we address the thickness and temperature changes of these water masses using both individual temperature-salinity profiles and optimal interpolated products from Argo data. Isopycnal decomposition allows us to characterize the water mass interannual variability and decadal trends of volume and OHC. During the last decade (2006-2015), much of interannual and decadal warming is associated with Southern Hemisphere Subtropical Mode Water and Subantarctic Mode Water, particularly in the South Pacific Eastern Subtropical Mode Water, the Southeastern Indian Subantarctic Mode Water, and the Southern Pacific Subantarctic Mode Water. In contrast, Antarctic Intermediate Water in the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic Subtropical Mode Water in the Northern Hemisphere have cooled. This OHC interannual variability is mainly explained by volume (or mass) changes of water masses related to the isopycnal heaving. The forcing mechanisms and interior dynamics of water masses are discussed in the context of the wind stress change and ocean adjustment occurring at interannual time scale.},

Here, we present 17 high-depth-resolution profiles of dissolved Cd and its stable isotope composition (delta Cd-114) over the top 1000 m of the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean, collected during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition. Our dataset reinforces the view that Cd and its isotopes are dominated by shallow biological cycling in this region. A close examination of variations in Cd cycling across the different zones of the Southern Ocean reveals how the interplay between uptake and regeneration, seasonal mixing, and upwelling controls both Cd and Cd in this region. The only deviations from these systematics are due to the influence of local processes such as continental influence or Fe-fertilization, close to the Mertz Glacier and the Balleny Islands, respectively. Deep convection during winter incorporates the Southern Ocean Cd isotope signatures into Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water during water mass formation. Incorporating published data, we present the first complete picture of how Cd is cycled through the entire Pacific Ocean, revealing the manner in which the Southern Ocean controls the global cycling of Cd and Cd; analogous to Si or Zn, we propose that Southern Ocean processes, in combination with global ocean circulation, cause a division into two separate Cd regimes, a Cd-depleted surface ocean above a Cd-rich deep ocean loop. Therefore, the relationship between Cd and PO4 on a global scale is largely a result of these processes in the Southern Ocean, rather than a local correlation between the two elements.},

	abstract = {The mesoscale contribution to subduction in the Southern Ocean was studied by Sallee and Rintoul in 2011 (SR11) using the following mesoscale model. The adiabatic (A) regime was modeled with the Gent-McWilliams streamfunction, the diabatic (D) regime was modeled with tapering functions, the D-A interface was taken to be at the mixed layer depth, and the mesoscale diffusivity either was a constant or was given by a 2D model. Since the resulting subductions were an order of magnitude smaller than the data of +/- 200 m yr(-1) as reported by Mazloff et al. in 2010, SR11 showed that if, instead of the above model-dependent mesoscale diffusivities, they employed the ones reported in 2008 by Sallee et al. from surface drifter observations, the subductions compared significantly better to the data. On those grounds, SR11 suggested a 10-fold increase of the diffusivity. In this work, we suggest that, since the mesoscale diffusivity is but one component of a much large mesoscale parameterization, one should first assess the latter's overall performance followed by an assessment of the predicted Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) subduction. We employ the mesoscale model formulated by Canuto et al. in 2018 and 2019 that includes recent theoretical and observational advances and that was assessed against a variety of data, including the output of 17 other OGCMs. The ACC diffusivities compare well to drifter data from Sallee et al., and the ACC subduction rates are in agreement with the data.},

Multidecadal (1980-2018) local temperature trends from a hydrographic data set are examined at the winter mixed layer base and partitioned into components relating to isopycnal movement (heave) and change along isopycnals (spice). Subtropical gyres and western boundary currents show warming larger than the global average that mostly projects onto heave. This is the result of the strengthening of the circulation in the Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyres and is related to both wind-driven changes and Southern Ocean warming.

	abstract = {Using an Argo dataset and the ECCOv4 reanalysis, a volume budget was performed to address the main mechanisms driving the volume change of the interior water masses in the Southern Hemisphere oceans between 2006 and 2015. The subduction rates and the isopycnal and diapycnal water-mass transformation were estimated in a density-spiciness (sigma-tau) framework. Spiciness, defined as thermohaline variations along isopycnals, was added to the potential density coordinates to discriminate between water masses spreading on isopycnal layers. The main positive volume trends were found to be associated with the Subantarctic Mode Waters (SAMW) in the South Pacific and South Indian Ocean basins, revealing a lightening of the upper waters in the Southern Hemisphere. The SAMW exhibits a two-layer density structure in which subduction and diapycnal transformation from the lower to the upper layers accounted for most of the upper-layer volume gain and lower-layer volume loss, respectively. The Antarctic Intermediate Waters, defined here between the 27.2 and 27.5 kg m(-3) isopycnals, showed the strongest negative volume trends. This volume loss can be explained by their negative isopyncal transformation southward of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the fresher and colder Antarctic Winter Waters (AAWW) and northward into spicier tropical/subtropical Intermediate Waters. The AAWW is destroyed by obduction back into the mixed layer so that its net volume change remains nearly zero. The proposed mechanisms to explain the transformation within the Intermediate Waters are discussed in the context of Southern Ocean dynamics. The sigma-tau decomposition provided new insight on the spatial and temporal water-mass variability and driving mechanisms over the last decade.},

The wind-driven gyre in the South Paciﬁc is relatively deep, reaching 2.4 km along the southern edge of the gyre.

The TTD describes the probability that water at a given interior point in the ocean was at some point on the ocean surface a given amount of time ago. It is shown that the spatial distribution of ocean TTDs can be understood in terms of conventional wisdom regarding time scales and pathways of the ventilated thermocline and the thermohaline circulation–driven deep-ocean circulation. The true mean age from the model (the first moment of the TTD) is demonstrated to be very large everywhere, because of very long-tailed distributions. Regional TTD distributions are presented for distinct surface boundary subregions, and it is shown how these can help in the interpretation of the global TTD. The spatial structure of each regional TTD is shown to become essentially the same at relatively long times. The form of the TTD at a given point in the ocean can be very simple, but some regions do exhibit more complicated multimodal distributions. The degree to which a simple functional approximation to the TTD is able to predict the spatial and temporal evolution of selected idealized tracers (for which interior sources and sinks are known or zero) with knowledge of only the tracer surface boundary condition is explored.},

Simulations show that the Southern Ocean south of 308S, occupying 30\% of global surface ocean area, accounts for 43\% 6 3\% (42 6 5 Pg C) of anthropogenic CO2 and 75\% 6 22\% (23 6 9 3 1022 J) of heat uptake by the ocean over the historical period. Northward transport out of the Southern Ocean is vigorous, reducing the storage to 33 6 6 Pg anthropogenic carbon and 12 6 7 3 1022 J heat in the region. The CMIP5 models, as a class, tend to underestimate the observation-based global anthropogenic carbon storage but simulate trends in global ocean heat storage over the last 50 years within uncertainties of observation-based estimates. CMIP5 models suggest global and Southern Ocean CO2 uptake have been largely unaffected by recent climate variability and change. Anthropogenic carbon and heat storage show a common broad-scale pattern of change, but ocean heat storage is more structured than ocean carbon storage. The results highlight the signiﬁcance of the Southern Ocean for the global climate and as the region where models differ the most in representation of anthropogenic CO2 and, in particular, heat uptake.},

Three models are considered. Model 1 from Holm (Proc R Soc A 471:20140963, 2015) is reviewed, in which the spatial correlations are time independent. Two new models, called Model 2 and Model 3, introduce two different symmetry breaking mechanisms by which the spatial correlations may be advected by the ﬂow. These models are derived using reduction by symmetry of stochastic variational principles, leading to stochastic Hamiltonian systems, whose momentum maps, conservation laws and Lie–Poisson bracket structures are used in developing the new stochastic Hamiltonian models of GFD.},

	abstract = {Oceans play a major role in Earth’s climate by storing and transporting heat via turbulent currents called mesoscale eddies. However, direct monitoring of eddy-driven heat ﬂuxes is currently impossible because it requires simultaneous surface and subsurface observations of velocity and heat content, while only surface properties of mesoscale eddies can be comprehensively measured by satellites in the form of sea surface height (SSH) anomalies. Nonetheless, surface and subsurface expressions of eddies are dynamically linked, suggesting that surface observations may contain at least partial information about subsurface ﬂows and thus heat transport. Here we used deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to demonstrate that SSH expressions of mesoscale turbulence contain sufﬁcient information to predict about 64\% of eddy heat ﬂux variance, with CNNs signiﬁcantly outperforming other conventional data-driven techniques. Our results suggest that deep CNNs could provide an effective pathway towards an operational monitoring of eddy heat ﬂuxes using satellite altimetry.},

While CICE simulations show a broad region of anomalously thin ice in April 2017 relative to the 2011–2017 mean, analysis of three CryoSat-2 products show more limited regions with thin ice and do not always agree with each other, both in magnitude and direction of thickness anomalies. CICE is further used to diagnose feedback processes driving the observed anomalies, showing 11–13 cm reduced thermodynamic ice growth over the Arctic domain used in this study compared to the 2011–2017 mean, and dynamical contributions of +1 to +4 cm. Finally, CICE model simulations from 1985 to 2017 indicate the negative feedback relationship between ice growth and winter air temperatures may be starting to weaken, showing decreased winter ice growth since 2012, as winter air temperatures have increased and the freeze-up has been further delayed.},

	abstract = {Changes in ventilation of the Southern Hemisphere oceans in response to changes in midlatitude westerly winds are examined by analyzing the ideal age tracer from global eddy-permitting ocean–ice model simulations in which there is an abrupt increase and/or a meridional shift in the winds. The age response in mode and intermediate waters is found to be close to linear; the response of a combined increase and shift of peak winds is similar to the sum of the individual responses to an increase and a shift. Further, a barotropic response, following Sverdrup balance, can explain much of the age response to the changes in wind stress. There are similar peak decreases (of around 50 years) in the ideal age for a 40\% increase or 2.58 poleward shift in the wind stress. However, while the age decreases throughout the thermocline for an increase in the winds, for a poleward shift in the winds the age increases in the north part of the thermocline and there are decreases in age only south of 358S. As a consequence, the change in the volume of young water differs, with a 15\% increase in the volume of water with ages younger than 50 years for a 40\% increase in the winds but essentially no change in this volume for a 2.58 shift. As ventilation plays a critical role in the uptake of carbon and heat, these results suggest that the storage of anthropogenic carbon and heat in mode and intermediate waters will likely increase with a strengthening of the winds, but will be much less sensitive to a meridional shift in the peak wind stress.},

	abstract = {Ocean ventilation is the process that transports water and climatically important trace gases such as carbon dioxide from the surface mixed layer into the ocean interior. Quantifying the dominant source regions and time scales remains a major challenge in oceanography. A mathematically rigorous approach, that accounts for the multiplicity of transport pathways and transit times characteristic of an eddy-diffusive ﬂow such as the ocean, is to quantify ventilation in terms of a probability distribution that partitions ﬂuid parcels according to the time and location of their last surface contact. Here, we use globally gridded radiocarbon data in combination with other transient (CFCs) and hydrographic (temperature, salinity, phosphate, and oxygen) tracer data to estimate the joint distribution of age and surface origin of deep ocean waters. Our results show that {\textasciitilde}40\% and 26\% of the global ocean was last in contact with the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, respectively. Some 80\% of the global deep ocean below 1500 m is ventilated from these high latitude regions. However, contrary to the classical description of the deep ocean as a roughly equal mixture of “northern” and “southern” source waters, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly higher contribution from the Southern Ocean relative to the North Atlantic. We estimate the mean transit time from the surface to the deep North Paciﬁc at 1360± 350 y, intermediate between two widely used radiocarbon-based estimates. To reconcile our estimate of the ideal mean age with ventilation age estimates based on radiocarbon, we apply the estimated distribution function to construct a 3-dimensional distribution of the water mass fraction-weighted surface “initial” radiocarbon concentration that can serve as an accurate reservoir age. Radiocarbon ages corrected for this initial reservoir age are found to be in good agreement (within 5\%) with our ideal age estimate, demonstrating that it is essential to take into account the spatially variable surface radiocarbon ﬁeld when computing ventilation ages using radiocarbon. A wide spectrum of ages contributes to the mean age, providing evidence for the fundamentally eddy-diffusive nature of the large-scale general circulation of the ocean. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Biogeochemical Argo ﬂoats, proﬁling to 2,000-m depth, are being deployed throughout the Southern Ocean by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program (SOCCOM). The goal is 200 ﬂoats by 2020, to provide the ﬁrst full set of annual cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, and optical properties across multiple oceanographic regimes. Building from no prior coverage to a sparse array, deployments are based on prior knowledge of water mass properties, mean frontal locations, mean circulation and eddy variability, winds, air-sea heat/freshwater/carbon exchange, prior Argo trajectories, and ﬂoat simulations in the Southern Ocean State Estimate and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Twelve ﬂoats deployed from the 2014–2015 Polarstern cruise from South Africa to Antarctica are used as a test case to evaluate the deployment strategy adopted for SOCCOM’s 20 deployment cruises and 126 ﬂoats to date. After several years, these ﬂoats continue to represent the deployment zones targeted in advance: (1) Weddell Gyre sea ice zone, observing the Antarctic Slope Front, and a decadally-rare polynya over Maud Rise; (2) Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) including the topographically steered Southern Zone chimney where upwelling carbon/nutrient-rich deep waters produce surprisingly large carbon dioxide outgassing; (3) Subantarctic and Subtropical zones between the ACC and Africa; and (4) Cape Basin. Argo ﬂoats and eddy-resolving HYCOM simulations were the best predictors of individual SOCCOM ﬂoat pathways, with uncertainty after 2 years of order 1,000 km in the sea ice zone and more than double that in and north of the ACC. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, is a huge, very sparsely observed region. But we know from the decades of observations and from computer models that the Southern Ocean is a major player in the Earth’s climate, taking up a signiﬁcant fraction of the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and absorbing a large fraction of the extra heat that results from that extra carbon dioxide. The extra carbon dioxide is also acidifying the Southern Ocean waters. To observe these, we are expanding one of the major ocean-observing systems: Argo proﬁling ﬂoats that measure temperature and salinity to 2,000-m depth every 10 days. SOCCOM has (1) added extra sensors that measure the ocean’s pH, oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll, and particles; (2) developed algorithms to derive the rest of the carbon budget terms, and (3) vigorously expanded Argo into the enormous seasonal ice zone. We are deploying about 30 ﬂoats per year all around Antarctica. We describe our strategy for ﬂoat deployments in 2014 in the large region between Africa and Antarctica, describing the circulation, water properties, and forcing of this region. We evaluate how well we met our goal of sampling each of the distinct oceanographic regimes.},

	abstract = {The spatial correlation scales of oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon, heat content, and carbon and heat exchanges with the atmosphere are estimated from a realistic numerical simulation of the Southern Ocean. Biases in the model are assessed by comparing the simulated sea surface height and temperature scales to those derived from optimally interpolated satellite measurements. While these products do not resolve all ocean scales, they are representative of the climate scale variability we aim to estimate. Results show that constraining the carbon and heat inventory between 358S and 708S on time-scales longer than 90 days requires approximately 100 optimally spaced measurement platforms: approximately one platform every 208 longitude by 68 latitude. Carbon ﬂux has slightly longer zonal scales, and requires a coverage of approximately 308 by 68. Heat ﬂux has much longer scales, and thus a platform distribution of approximately 908 by 108 would be sufﬁcient. Fluxes, however, have signiﬁcant subseasonal variability. For all ﬁelds, and especially ﬂuxes, sustained measurements in time are required to prevent aliasing of the eddy signals into the longer climate scale signals. Our results imply a minimum of 100 biogeochemical-Argo ﬂoats are required to monitor the Southern Ocean carbon and heat content and air-sea exchanges on time-scales longer than 90 days. However, an estimate of formal mapping error using the current Argo array implies that in practice even an array of 600 ﬂoats (a nominal ﬂoat density of about 1 every 78 longitude by 38 latitude) will result in nonnegligible uncertainty in estimating climate signals.},

In these OSSEs, designed to be relevant to the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observation and Modeling (SOCCOM) project, the simulated ﬂoats move with oceanic currents and sample dissolved oxygen and inorganic carbon. The annual mean and seasonal cycle of these ﬁelds are then reconstructed and compared to the original model ﬁelds. The reconstruction skill is quantiﬁed with the reconstruction error (RErr), deﬁned as the difference between the reconstructed and actual model ﬁelds, weighted by a local measure of the spatiotemporal variability. The square of the RErr is small ({\textless}0.5) for 150 ﬂoats in most of the domain, which is interpreted to mean that the reconstruction skill is high. An idealized analytical study demonstrates that the RErr depends on the magnitude of the seasonal cycle, spatial gradients, speed of ﬂoat movement, amplitude of mesoscale variability, and number of ﬂoats. These factors explain a large part of the spatial variability in the RErr and can be used to predict the reconstruction skill of the SOCCOM array. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that an array size of 150 ﬂoats is a reasonable choice for reconstruction of surface properties and annual-mean 2000 m inventories, with the exception of the seasonal cycle in parts of the Indo-Atlantic, and that doubling this number to 300 results in a very modest increase in the reconstruction skill for dissolved oxygen.},

We demonstrate that artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are a useful addition to the climate science “toolbox” for this purpose. Speciﬁcally, forced patterns are detected by an ANN trained on climate model simulations under historical and future climate scenarios. By identifying spatial patterns that serve as indicators of change in surface temperature and precipitation, the ANN can determine the approximate year from which the simulations came without ﬁrst explicitly separating the forced signal from the noise of both internal climate variability and model uncertainty. Thus, the ANN indicator patterns are complex, nonlinear combinations of signal and noise and are identiﬁed from the 1960s onward in simulated and observed surface temperature maps. This approach suggests that viewing climate patterns through an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) lens has the power to uncover new insights into climate variability and change.},

This method is applied on the Monthly Isopycnal and Mixed-Layer Ocean Climatology (MIMOC). The ﬁrst three modes account for 92\% of the joint temperature and salinity (T–S) variance, which yields a surprisingly good reduction of dimensionality. The ﬁrst mode (69\% of the variance) is related to the thermocline depth and delineates the subtropical gyres. The second mode (18\%) is mostly driven by salinity and mainly displays the asymmetry between the North Paciﬁc and Atlantic basins and the salty circumpolar deep waters in the Southern Ocean. The third mode (5\%) identiﬁes the low- and high-salinity intermediate waters, covarying with the freshwater inputs of the upper ocean. The representation of the ocean in the space deﬁned by the ﬁrst three modes offers a simple visualization of the global thermohaline structure that strikingly emphasizes the role of the Southern Ocean in linking and distributing water masses to the other basins. The vertical thermohaline modes offer a convenient framework for model and observation data comparison. This is illustrated by projecting the repeated Paciﬁc section P16 together with proﬁles from the Array for Real-Time Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) global array of proﬁling ﬂoats on the modes deﬁned with the climatology MIMOC. These thermohaline modes have a potential for water mass identiﬁcation and robust analysis of heat and salt content.},

	abstract = {Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) in the Paciﬁc forms in two distinct pools in the south central and southeast Paciﬁc, which subduct into the ocean interior and impact global storage of heat and carbon. Wintertime thickness of the central and eastern SAMW pools vary predominantly out of phase with each other, by up to ±150 m between years, resulting in an interannual thickness see‐saw. The thickness in the eastern (central) pool is found to be strongly positively (negatively) correlated with both the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The relative phases of the SAM and ENSO set the SAMW thickness, with in phase reinforcing modes in 2005–2008 and 2012–2017 driving strong differences between the pools. Between 2008 and 2012 out of phase atmospheric modes result in less coherent SAMW patterns. SAMW thickness is dominated by local formation driven by SAM and ENSO modulated wind stress and turbulent heat ﬂuxes. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean around Antarctica is a dominant pathway for moving heat and carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean interior, trapping it for hundreds of years. Most of this uptake is achieved through the formation of “mode waters”, homogeneous layers of water several hundred meters thick, by sinking and overturning as surface waters cool in winter. We ﬁnd that two distinct pools of mode water in the South Paciﬁc vary dramatically in winter thickness and volume from year to year. They vary in opposition to one another; when one is thicker than normal the other is thinner, with the pattern reversing after a year or so. We show that this “see‐saw” in thickness is strongest when the two main atmospheric patterns of climate variability over the Southern Ocean are reinforcing one another and weaken when they oppose one another. The combination of these patterns of atmospheric variability sets local mode water thickness via surface winds and ocean heat loss. The discovery of such strong dependence of mode water heat content on these atmospheric patterns is important for climate. Atmospheric variability is predicted to change into the future, potentially impacting heat uptake by mode waters and inﬂuencing global surface temperatures.},

A new upper ocean water mass census based on observations from the Argo profiling float program is presented, to revisit Worthington’s 1981 calculation exploiting the nearly global coverage and especially the wintertime resolution in these newer data, notably problematic with ship-based hydrography. Water mass volumes and stratification are calculated from the Argo data and used to describe the global distribution of mode waters and their seasonal cycle. Water mass transformation rates are derived from a global state-estimate of the ocean and air–sea fluxes and applied to mode water density classes, to infer formation rates and to relate these to seasonal volumetric changes. A conceptual framework has been applied to the generation of mode water in terms of PV fluxes at the sea surface; dynamical mechanisms relevant to the impact of mode waters on circulation are summarized. Some results with climate simulations are noted, for the role of mode water in climate variability.},

Both SAMW and AAIW experience substantial interannual to interdecadal variability, signiﬁcantly linked to the action of the Amundsen Sea low (ASL) in their formation areas. Observations suggest that the interdecadal freshening tendency evident in SAMW over the past three decades has recently abated, while AAIW has warmed signiﬁcantly since the early 2000s. The two water masses have also experienced a substantial lightening since the start of the record. Examination of the mechanisms underpinning water mass property variability shows that SAMW characteristics are controlled predominantly by a combination of air–sea turbulent heat ﬂuxes, cross-frontal Ekman transport of Antarctic surface waters, and the evaporation–precipitation balance in the Subantarctic zone of the southeast Paciﬁc and Drake Passage, while AAIW properties reﬂect air–sea turbulent heat ﬂuxes and sea ice formation in the Bellingshausen Sea. The recent interdecadal evolution of the ASL is consistent with both the dominance of the processes described here and the response of SAMW and AAIW on that time scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Southern Ocean features regionally-varying ventilation pathways that transport heat and carbon from the surface ocean to the interior thermocline on timescales of decades to centuries, but the factors that control the distribution of heat along these pathways are not well understood. In this study, we use a global ocean state estimate (ECCOv4) to (1) define the recently ventilated interior Pacific (RVP) using numerical passive tracer experiments over a 10-year period and (2) use an adjoint approach to calculate the sensitivities of the RVP heat content (RVPh) to changes in net heat flux and wind stress. We find that RVPh is most sensitive to local heat flux and wind stress anomalies north of the sea surface height contours that delineate the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with especially high sensitivities over the South Pacific Gyre. Surprisingly, RVPh is not especially sensitive to changes at higher latitudes. We perform a set of step response experiments over the South Pacific Gyre, the subduction region, and the high-latitude SO. In consistency with the adjoint sensitivity fields, RVPh is most sensitive to wind stress curl over the subtropical gyre, which alter isopycnal heave, and it is only weakly sensitive to changes at higher latitudes. Our results suggest that despite the localized nature of mode water subduction hotspots, changes in basin-scale pressure gradients are an important controlling factor on RVPh. Because basin-scale wind stress is expected to change in the coming decades to centuries, our results may have implications for climate, via the atmosphere/ocean partitioning of heat.},

Here, it is shown that extended observation of the broad-scale hydrography by Argo provides a path to improved estimates of regional turbulent transport rates. Results from a 20-year ocean state estimate produced with the ECCO v4 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, version 4) non-linear inverse modeling framework provide supporting evidence. Turbulent transport parameter maps are estimated under the constraints of ﬁtting the extensive collection of Argo proﬁles collected through 2011. The adjusted parameters dramatically reduce misﬁts to in situ proﬁles as compared with earlier ECCO solutions. They also yield a clear reduction in the model drift away from observations over multi-century-long simulations, both for assimilated variables (temperature and salinity) and independent variables (biogeochemical tracers). Despite the minimal constraints imposed speciﬁcally on the estimated parameters, their geography is physically plausible and exhibits close connections with the upper-ocean stratiﬁcation as observed by Argo. The estimated parameter adjustments furthermore have ﬁrst-order impacts on upper-ocean stratiﬁcation and mixed layer depths over 20 years. These results identify the constraint of ﬁtting Argo proﬁles as an effective observational basis for regional turbulent transport rate inversions. Uncertainties and further improvements of the method are discussed.},

This study uses an isopycnal climatology constructed from Argo conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) proﬁle data to deﬁne the current state of the AAIW salinity minimum (its core) and thence compute anomalies of AAIW core pressure, potential temperature, salinity, and potential density since the mid-1970s from shipbased CTD proﬁles. The results are used to calculate maps of temporal property trends at the AAIW core, where statistically signiﬁcant strong circumpolar shoaling (30–50 dbar decade21), warming (0.058–0.158C decade21), and density reductions [up to 20.03 (kg m23) decade21] are found. These trends are strongest just north of the ACC in the southeast Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans and decrease equatorward. Salinity trends are generally small, with their sign varying regionally. Bottle data are used to extend the AAIW core potential temperature anomaly analysis back to 1925 in the Atlantic and to ;1960 elsewhere. The modern warm AAIW core conditions appear largely unprecedented in the historical record: biennially and zonally binned median AAIW core potential temperatures within each ocean basin are, with the notable exception of the subtropical South Atlantic in the 1950s–70s, 0.2–18C colder than modern values. Zonally averaged sea surface temperature anomalies around the AAIW formation latitudes in each ocean and sectoral southern annular mode indices are used to put the AAIW core property trends and variations into context.},

	abstract = {As part of the WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) Hydrographic Programme (WHP), nominally zonal lines across the subtropical gyres in the Southern Hemisphere oceans were occupied from 1992 to 1995: line P06 (nominally along 32.5°S in the Pacific Ocean), A10 (along 30°S in the Atlantic Ocean), and I03 and I04 (along 20°S in the Indian Ocean). These lines were revisited from 2003 to 2004 to examine changes in circulation and water properties over the 8- to 12-year interval between visits. A simple comparison of the two hydrographic sections would be affected by variations with time scales shorter than the interval between visits even in the deep ocean, so two ocean global circulation models, OFES and SODA, were employed to study meridional flux changes. A time series of the heat flux across the latitude circle 32.5°S from 1980 to 2005 shows moderate negative correlations (with the correlation coefficient r=−0.5 to −0.6) with the Southern Oscillation Index. A composite study shows that during El Niño years, the westerly jet just south of 32.5°S in the Pacific shifts northward, resulting in a northward Ekman temperature transport anomaly, and thus weaker southward temperature transport. The transport variations also show moderate negative correlations (r=−0.4 to −0.6) with the Southern Annular Mode Index. A similar composite study shows that during positive Southern Annular Mode Index years, the Ekman pumping anomaly around 32.5°S spins down the wind-driven gyre over the South Indian and South Pacific oceans, causing a southward transport anomaly. The Atlantic transport is not sensitive to either index. An Ekman transport anomaly in the South Indian Ocean also contributes to the southward transport anomaly. The salt transports are correlated negatively with the Southern Oscillation Index which is similarly explained by the Ekman transport, but the relationship between the salt transport and the Southern Annular Mode Index remains unknown. The substantial seasonal or higher-frequency variations are filtered out by comparing the water properties on neutral density surfaces. Along the South Pacific P06 line, Subantarctic Mode Water on γ=26.8 (the neutral density surface of 1026.8kgm−3) becomes cooler and fresher by up to 0.2°C and 0.04 psu (practical salinity unit). The property changes are largest in the Chile Basin and smallest in the Tasman Sea. In the deep Southwest Pacific Basin, a small but statistically significant freshening of 0.002 psu was found in the Circumpolar Deep Water (γ=28.11). Along the South Atlantic A10 line, Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water were found warmer and saltier to the east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (e.g. by 0.2°C and 0.05 psu on γ=26.8; 0.1°C and 0.02 psu on γ=27.4). North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water were found warmer and saltier particularly in the Argentine Basin (e.g. by 0.02°C and 0.004 psu onγ=28.0; 0.01°C and 0.002 psu on γ=28.2). Along the south Indian I03/I04 lines, Subantarctic Mode Water was found warmer and saltier to the west of 95°E (e.g. by 0.2°C and 0.05 psu on γ=26.8) and cooler and fresher to the east (e.g. a difference of −0.2°C and −0.05 psu on γ=26.8).},

The period of analysis extends from 1950 to 2008, taking care to minimize the aliasing associated with the seasonal and major global El Niño–Southern Oscillation modes. Large, robust, and spatially coherent multidecadal linear trends in salinity to 2000-dbar depth are found. Salinity increases at the sea surface are found in evaporation-dominated regions and freshening in precipitation-dominated regions, with the spatial pattern of change strongly resembling that of the mean salinity field, consistent with an amplification of the global hydrological cycle. Subsurface salinity changes on pressure surfaces are attributable to both isopycnal heave and real water-mass modification of the temperature–salinity relationship. Subduction and circulation by the ocean’s mean flow of surface salinity and temperature anomalies appear to account for most regional subsurface salinity changes on isopycnals. Broad-scale surface warming and the associated poleward migration of isopycnal outcrops drive a clear and repeating pattern of subsurface isopycnal salinity change in each independent ocean basin. Qualitatively, the observed global multidecadal salinity changes are thus consonant with both broad-scale surface warming and the amplification of the global hydrological cycle.},

	abstract = {Water-mass changes are estimated in the southwest Paciﬁc Ocean by comparing a meridional hydrographic section along 170ЊW between 60ЊS and the equator occupied in 1968/69 during the Southern Cross cruise and again in 1990 during a NOAA Climate and Global Change cruise. Another comparison is made using a hydrographic section along 35ЊS between the date line and 169ЊW occupied in 1969 during USNS Eltanin cruise 40 and again in 1991 during a Mapkiwi cruise. The most robust change consists of cooling (and freshening) on isopycnals, with peak differences exceeding Ϫ1.0ЊC (Ϫ0.25 pss) at the base of the subtropical thermocline. The cooling and freshening starts above the stratiﬁcation minimum of the Subantarctic Mode Water and persists to below the salinity minimum of the Antarctic Intermediate Water. Amplitudes are largest at 48ЊS, near where these water masses subduct, and decay toward 20ЊS, near the axis of the Subtropical Gyre. This change is likely the result of surface warming and/or freshening at high latitudes, where these water masses are formed before they ventilate the base of the subtropical thermocline. Isopycnals tend to deepen south of 35ЊS and to shoal more weakly from 35Њ to 20ЊS. These changes are consistent with a simple model response to high-latitude warming. Results from the section comparisons are put in a larger context by estimating interdecadal changes on isopycnals throughout the South Paciﬁc Ocean. In addition, two changes consistent with a strengthened southern inﬂuence are found within the Lower Circumpolar Water from the Chatham Rise at 43ЊS to the Samoa Passage at 10ЊS. Cooling and freshening erode the top of the deep salinity maximum of the modiﬁed North Atlantic Deep Water. In the weakly stratiﬁed abyssal layer, the modiﬁed Antarctic Bottom water cools by about 0.025ЊC.},

	abstract = {Abstract Changes in atmospheric forcing can affect the subsurface water column of the ocean by three different mechanisms. First, warmed mixed-layer water that is subducted into the ocean interior will cause subsurface warming; second, the subducted surface water can be freshened through changes in evaporation and precipitation; and third, the properties at a given depth may be changed by the vertical displacement of isotherms and isohalines without changes of water masses. These vertical displacements of the water column can be caused either by changes in the rates of renewal of water masses or by dynamical changes (such as changes in wind stress). A method for analysing the subsurface temporal changes in hydrographic data is described in terms of these three processes: “pure warming,” “pure freshening,” and “pure heave.” Linear relations are derived for the relative strength of each process in terms of the observed changes of potential temperature and salinity in two different coordinate frames: (i) constant density surfaces, and (ii) isobaric surfaces. Inverse methods are applied to three realizations of the SCORPIO section at 43°S in the Tasman Sea. These sections were obtained in 1967, and in the austral winter and summer of 1989 and 1990, respectively. This data is used to explore the relative strengths of surface warming, surface freshening, and heave of the water column. The six-month differences for this region show small changes in Sub-Antarctic mode water (SAMW) and are not characterized by any one process, whereas below the mode waters the observed differences are well described by the heave process. In contrast, the 23-year differences show significant changes in the properties of the water that flows into the Tasman Sea: SAMW (300-700 db) is well described by pure warming of near- surface waters, while the changes observed at the depth of the salinity minimum are consistent with pure freshening. The observed changes in the interior of the ocean between adjacent seasons do not exhibit significant changes of water masses, consistent with the distance of this section from the outcrop region of the density surfaces of interest. For the 23-year differences, changed surface waters subducted into the ocean interior have sufficient time to influence the temperature-salinity correlations. The skill of our approach in discriminating between short-term changes (almost exclusively heave) and long-term changes associated with the subduction of changed surface waters is particularly encouraging. Although the observed changes could equally well be natural variability, they are qualitatively consistent with coupled numerical models of climate change in which surface waters are warmed and increased precipitation occurs south of the Sub-Antarctic Front.},

	abstract = {The top 2000 m of the Southern Ocean has freshened and warmed over recent decades. However, the highlatitude (south of 508S) southeast Paciﬁc was observed to be cooler and fresher in the years 2008–10 compared to 2005–07 over a wide depth range including surface, mode, and intermediate waters. The causes and impacts of this event are analyzed using the ocean–sea ice data-assimilating Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) and observationally based products. In 2008–10, a strong positive southern annular mode coincided with a negative El Niño–Southern Oscillation and a deep Amundsen Sea low. Enhanced meridional winds drove strong sea ice export from the eastern Ross Sea, bringing large amounts of ice to the Amundsen Sea ice edge. In 2008, together with increased precipitation, this introduced a strong freshwater anomaly that was advected eastward by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), mixing along the way. This anomaly entered the ocean interior not only as Antarctic Intermediate Water, but also as lighter Southeast Paciﬁc Subantarctic Mode Water (SEPSAMW). A numerical particle release experiment carried out in SOSE showed that the Ross Sea sector was the dominant source of particles reaching the SEPSAMW formation region. This suggests that large-scale climate ﬂuctuations can induce strong interannual variability of volume and properties of SEPSAMW. These ﬂuctuations act at different time scales: instantaneously via direct forcing and also lagged over advective time scales of several years from upstream regions.},

	abstract = {An ocean mixed-layer model has been incorporated into the Los Alamos sea ice model CICE to investigate regional variations in the surface-driven formation of Antarctic shelf waters. This model captures well the expected sea ice thickness distribution, and produces deep ({\textgreater} 500 m) mixed layers in the Weddell and Ross shelf seas each winter. This results in the complete destratification of the water column in deep southern coastal regions leading to high-salinity shelf water (HSSW) formation, and also in some shallower regions (no HSSW formation) of these seas. Shallower mixed layers are produced in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas. By deconstructing the surface processes driving the mixed-layer depth evolution, we show that the net salt flux from sea ice growth/melt dominates the evolution of the mixed layer in all regions, with a smaller contribution from the surface heat flux and a negligible input from wind stress. The Weddell and Ross shelf seas receive an annual surplus of mixing energy at the surface; the Amundsen shelf sea energy input in autumn/winter is balanced by energy extraction in spring/summer; and the Bellingshausen shelf sea experiences an annual surface energy deficit, through both a low energy input in autumn/winter and the highest energy loss in spring/summer. An analysis of the sea ice mass balance demonstrates the contrasting mean ice growth, melt and export in each region. The Weddell and Ross shelf seas have the highest annual ice growth, with a large fraction exported northwards each year, whereas the Bellingshausen shelf sea experiences the highest annual ice melt, driven by the advection of ice from the northeast. A linear regression analysis is performed to determine the link between the autumn/winter mixed-layer deepening and several atmospheric variables. The Weddell and Ross shelf seas show stronger spatial correlations (temporal mean – intra-regional variability) between the autumn/winter mixed-layer deepening and several atmospheric variables compared to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen. In contrast, the Amundsen and Bellingshausen shelf seas show stronger temporal correlations (shelf sea mean – interannual variability) between the autumn/winter mixed-layer deepening and several atmospheric variables.},

With the help of an adjoint model, it is shown that scalar diagnostics or objective functions in a coarse-resolution model, such as the transport through Drake Passage, the strength of the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation, the Deacon cell, and the meridional heat transport across 32°S, are sensitive to bottom topography as much as they are to surface boundary conditions. For example, adjoint topography sensitivities of the transport through Drake Passage are large in choke-point areas such as the Crozet–Kerguélen Plateau and south of New Zealand; the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is sensitive to topography in the western boundary region of the North Atlantic Ocean and along the Scotland–Iceland Ridge. Many sensitivities are connected to steep topography and can be interpreted in terms of bottom form stress, that is, the product of bottom pre...},

Ice-shelf geometry and global ocean bathymetry have been derived from the RTopo-1 dataset. A global domain with a triangular mesh and a hybrid vertical coordinate is used. To evaluate sub-ice-shelf circulation and melt rates for present-day climate, the model is forced with NCEP reanalysis data. Basal mass fluxes are mostly realistic, with maximum melt rates in the deepest parts near the grounding lines and marine ice formation in the northern sectors of the Ross and Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelves, Antarctica. Total basal mass loss for the ten largest ice shelves reflects the importance of the Amundsen Sea ice shelves; the Getz Ice Shelf is shown to be a major meltwater contributor to the Southern Ocean. Despite their modest melt rates, the ‘cold water’ ice shelves in the Weddell Sea are still substantial sinks of continental ice in Antarctica. Discrepancies between the model and observations can partly be attributed to deficiencies in the forcing data or to (sometimes unavoidable) smoothing of ice-shelf and bottom topographies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The coupling of physics and biology was examined along a 160 km long transect running out from the north coast of South Georgia Island and crossing the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) during late December 2000. Surface and near surface potential TS properties indicated the presence of three water types: a near-shore group of stations characterised by water which became progressively warmer and fresher closer to South Georgia, an offshore grouping in which sea surface temperatures and those at the winter water level were relatively warm (1.8degreesC and 0.5degreesC, respectively), and a third in which surface and winter water temperatures were cooler and reflected the presence of the SACCF. The transect bisected the SACCF twice, revealing that it was flowing in opposite directions, north-westward closest to South Georgia and south-eastwards at its furthest point from the island. The innermost limb was a narrow intense feature located just off the shelf break in 2000-3500m of water and in which rapid surface baroclinic velocities (up to 35cm s(-1)) were encountered. Offshore in the outermost limb, shown subsequently to be a mesoscale eddy that had meandered south from the retroflected limb of the SACCF, flow was broader and slower with peak velocities around 20cm s(-1). Chlorophyll a biomass was generally low ({\textless} 1 mg m(-3)) over much of the transect but increased dramatically in the region of the innermost limb of the SACCF, where a deepening of the surface mixed layer was coincident with a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (7.4 mg m(-3)) and elevated concentrations down to 100m. The bloom was coincident with depleted nutrient concentrations, particularly silicate, nitrate and phosphate, and although ammonium concentrations were locally depleted the bloom lay within an elevated band (up to 1.5 mmol m(-3)) associated with the frontal jet. Increased zooplankton abundance, higher copepod body carbon mass and egg production rates all showed a strong spatial integrity with the front. The population structure of the copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas at stations within the front suggested that rather than simply resulting from entrainment and concentration within the jet, increased copepod abundance was the result of development in situ. Estimates of bloom duration, based on silicate and carbon budget calculations, set the likely duration between 82 and 122d, a figure supported by the development schedule of the two copepod species. Given this timescale, model outputs from FRAM and OCCAM indicated that particles that occurred on the north side of South Georgia in December would have been in the central-southern Scotia Sea 2-3 months earlier, probably in sea ice affected regions.

Some recently developed Lagrangian techniques are used to picture and quantify the routes followed in the model by distinct water mass classes, defined by their initial temperature on model transatlantic sections at 10°S and 10°N. The qualitative description in terms of equatorial pathways of this warm component of the so-called global “conveyor belt” is found coherent with the most recent circulation schemes inferred from direct measurements. Diagnostics emphasize the crucial role of the western boundary current system and that of the equatorial subsurface jets in distributing the flow in the equatorial domain, both for northward-flowing and southward-recirculating warm water masses. As the model tracer fields are constrained to remain close to the observed climatology outside the equatorial strip, the circulation calculate...},

This primary production supports essentially all life in the oceans and profoundly affects global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This review discusses the general distribution of primary production in the sea, the processes that regulate this distribution, and how marine primary production is sensitive to climate variability and change. Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations. A paleoclimate record extends discussion to the centennial scale, providing contrasting insights into how marine primary production might vary in the future.},

This study shows that a total of about 23 Sv (Sv \${\textbackslash}equiv\$ 106 m3 s{\textbackslash}textminus1) is exported from Drake Passage to the equator. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are the main catchment basins with 7 and 15 Sv, respectively. Only 1–2 Sv of the water exported to the Atlantic equator follow the direct cold route from Drake Passage without entering the Indian Ocean. The remainder loops first into the Indian Ocean subtropical gyre and flows eventually into the Atlantic Ocean by Agulhas leakage. The authors assess the robustness of a theory that relates the export from Drake Passage to the equator to the wind stress over the Southern Ocean. Our GCM results are in reasonable agreement with the theory that predicts the total export. However, the theory cannot be applied to individual basins because of interocean exchanges through the “super...},

As diel vertical migrators, mesopelagic micronekton are recognized as an important trophic link between the deep scattering layer and upper surface waters, yet fundamental aspects of the life history and energetic contribution to the food web for most are undescribed. Here, we present newly derived regression equations for 32 species of mesopelagic fish and squid based on the relationship between body size and the size of hard parts typically used to identify prey species in predator diet studies. We describe the proximate composition and energy density of 31 species collected in the eastern Bering Sea during May 1999 and 2000. Energy values are categorized by body size as a proxy for relative age and can be cross-referenced with the derived regression equations. Data are tabularized to facilitate direct application to predator diet studies and food web models.},

	abstract = {An adjoint model is applied to examine the biophysical factors that control surface pCO$_{\textrm{2}}$ in different ocean regions. In the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans, the annual cycle of pCO$_{\textrm{2}}$ in the model is highly dominated by temperature variability, whereas both the temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are important in the tropical Pacific. In the high-latitude North Atlantic and Southern Oceans, DIC variability mainly drives the annual cycle of surface pCO$_{\textrm{2}}$. Phosphate addition significantly increases the carbon uptake in the tropical and subtropical regions, whereas nitrate addition increases the carbon uptake in the subarctic Pacific Ocean. The carbon uptake is also sensitive to changes in the physiological rate parameters in the ecosystem model in the equatorial Pacific, North Pacific, North Atlantic, and the Southern Ocean. Zooplankton grazing plays a major role in carbon exchange, especially in the HNLC regions. The grazing parameter regulates the phytoplankton biomass at the surface, thus controlling the biological production and the carbon uptake by photosynthesis. In the oligotrophic subtropical regions, the sea-to-air CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ flux is sensitive to changes in the phytoplankton exudation rate by altering the flux of regenerated nutrients essential for photosynthesis.},

	doi = {10.1575/1912/5611},
	abstract = {Mixing and stirring of passive tracer and Lagrangian particles in the open ocean was studied through comparison of observations from the North Atlantic Tracer Release Experiment, a numerical model, and existing theory. Based on the observed distribution of tracer during the first six months of the NATRE field experiment, Ledwell et al. (1993) estimated that on scales of 1 to 10 km small-scale diffusivity κs \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 3 m2s-1 and rms strain rate γ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 3 X 10-7 s-1 . From the observed tracer distribution after one year, Ledwell (personal communication) further estimated that on scales greater than the mesoscale the effective eddy diffusivity κe \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 1 x 103 m2s-1. In the present study, statistics of the NATRE float data and numerical simulations of Lagrangian particles and passive tracer were used to determine the biases and uncertainties associated with these estimates. The numerical model was calibrated so that the statistics of model floats agreed as closely as possible with the NATRE floats. It is found that observations of a passive tracer such as were made during the NATRE experiment may be used to determine the rms streak width, δs, and the rms strain rate and hence to estimate the effective small-scale diffusivity. However, caution must be exercised when estimating κs from the theoretical balance, δs = square root κs/γ, as this may introduce a bias which would lead to the over-estimation of κs. Of particular relevance to NATRE is that observations of δs may be biased toward larger estimated rms streak width due to the inability of the observer to distinguish individual streaks from those which have resulted from a recent merger of streaks. Numerical experiments show that such a bias could lead to the over-estimation of κs by up to a factor of 2 to 4, suggesting that the estimate of κs made by Ledwell et al., (1993) from the NATRE tracer observations has an associated uncertainty of similar magnitude. Analysis of NATRE float data indicates that the estimate κe \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 1 x 103 m2s-1 inferred from the tracer distribution in Spring, 1993 and Fall, 1994 is accurate to within a factor of 2.},

There has been a significant effort to identify and map these areas at a global scale, but the coarse resolution of most datasets masks the small-scale patterns associated with coastal habitats or seamounts. Here we used tuna longline observer data to investigate the role of seamounts in aggregating large pelagic biodiversity and to identify which pelagic species are associated with seamounts. Our analysis indicates that seamounts are hotspots of pelagic biodiversity. Higher species richness was detected in association with seamounts than with coastal or oceanic areas. Seamounts were found to have higher species diversity within 30-40 km of the summit, whereas for sets close to coastal habitat the diversity was lower and fairly constant with distance. Higher probability of capture and higher number of fish caught were detected for some shark, billfish, tuna, and other by-catch species. The study supports hypotheses that seamounts may be areas of special interest for management for marine pelagic predators.},

Key to mitigating bycatch is an understanding of the habitat requirements of target and nontarget species and the influence of heterogeneity and variability in the dynamic marine environment. While patterns of overlap among marine capture fisheries and habitats of a taxonomically diverse range of marine vertebrates have been reported, a mechanistic understanding of the real-time physical drivers of bycatch events is lacking. Moving from describing patterns toward understanding processes, we apply a Lagrangian analysis to a high-resolution ocean model output to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that drive fisheries interactions. We find that the likelihood of marine megafauna bycatch is intensified in attracting Lagrangian coherent structures associated with submesoscale and mesoscale filaments, fronts, and eddies. These results highlight how the real-time tracking of dynamic structures in the oceans can support fisheries sustainability and advance ecosystem-based management.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This quantity has been termed the bulk stability by Martinson. The bulk stability is found to consist of three components. The first two make up Martinson’s salt deficit and are the salt input needed to increase the density of the mixed layer and the pycnocline layer to that of the deep water (the mixed layer stability and pycnocline layer stability, respectively). The third component is Martinson’s thermal barrier: the potential for pycnocline heat to melt ice, reducing the surface salinity. It is found that when the pycnocline density gradient due to temperature offsets more than one half of that due to salinity, the pycnocline layer stability is negative. Consequently, it is poss...},

One common arrangement of the variables, known as the Arakawa C-grid, is particularly prone to gridscale noise that is due to spatial averaging of Coriolis terms and that is manifest when the grid resolution is coarse with respect to the deformation radius. Here, the authors analyze the problem in the context of linear inertia–gravity waves and discuss the reason for the prevalence of noise. They suggest a solution to the problem in which the C-grid model variables are augmented with D-grid velocity variables. An analysis of the resulting C–D grid indicates favorable behavior and numerical results are presented to demonstrate this. Finally, they discuss the similarity in nature between the C–D grid and the Z-grid, to explain why the C–D grid works well at both high and low resolution.},

	abstract = {Abstract Large buoyancy loss driving deep convection is often associated with a large wind stress that is typically omitted in simulations of convection. Here it is shown that this omission is not justified when overturning occurs in a horizontally inhomogeneous ocean. In strongly baroclinic flows, convective mixing is influenced both by the background horizontal density gradient and by the across-front advection of buoyancy due to wind. The former process—known as slantwise convection—results in deeper convection, while the effect of wind depends on the relative orientation of wind with respect to the baroclinic front. For the case of the Labrador Sea, wintertime winds act to destabilize the baroclinic Labrador Current causing a buoyancy removal roughly one-third as large as the air–sea buoyancy loss. Simulations using a nonhydrostatic numerical model, initialized and forced with observed fields from the Labrador Sea, show how the combination of wind and lateral gradients can result in significant convec...},

	abstract = {Heat redistribution is one of the main mechanisms by which oceans regulate Earth’s climate. Analyses of ocean heat transport tend to emphasize global-scale seawater pathways and concepts such as the great ocean conveyor belt. However, it is the divergence or convergence of heat transport within an oceanic region, rather than the origin or destination of seawater transiting through that region, that is most immediately relevant to Earth’s heat budget. Here we use a recent gridded estimate of ocean heat transport to reveal the net effect on Earth’s heat budget, the ‘effective’ ocean heat transport, by removing internal ocean heat loops that have obscured the interpretation of measurements. The result demonstrates the overwhelming predominance of the tropical Pacific, which exports four times as much heat as is imported in the Atlantic and Arctic. It also highlights the unique ability of the Atlantic and Indian oceans to transport heat across the Equator—Northward and Southward, respectively. However, effective inter-ocean heat transports are smaller than expected, suggesting that global-scale seawater pathways play only a minor role in Earth’s heat budget.},

A novel Lagrangian methodology has been developed for use with ocean models that enables a decomposition of the AMOC according to its source waters of subduction from the mixed layer of different geographical regions. The method is described here and used to decompose the AMOC of the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) ocean model, which is approximately 4.5 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s{\textbackslash}textminus1) too weak at 26°N, compared to observations. Contributions from mixed layer subduction to the peak AMOC at 26°N in the model are dominated by the Labrador Sea, which contributes 7.51 Sv; but contributions from the Nordic seas, the Irminger Sea, and the Rockall basin are also important. These waters mostly originate where deep mixed layers border the topographic slopes of the Subpolar Gyre and Nordic seas. The too-weak m...},

	abstract = {Maps of the gradient of sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) reveal that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) consists of multiple jets or frontal filaments. The braided and patchy nature of the gradient fields seems at odds with the traditional view, derived from hydrographic sections, that the ACC is made up of three continuous circumpolar fronts. By applying a nonlinear fitting procedure to 638 weekly maps of SSH gradient (del SSH), it is shown that the distribution of maxima in del SSH (i.e., fronts) is strongly peaked at particular values of absolute SSH (i.e., streamlines). The association between the jets and particular streamlines persists despite strong topographic and eddy - mean flow interactions, which cause the jets to merge, diverge, and fluctuate in intensity along their path. The SSH values corresponding to each frontal branch are nearly constant over the sector of the Southern Ocean between 100 degrees E and 180 degrees. The front positions inferred from SSH agree closely with positions inferred from hydrographic sections using traditional water mass criteria. Recognition of the multiple branches of the Southern Ocean fronts helps to reconcile differences between front locations determined by previous studies. Weekly maps of SSH are used to characterize the structure and variability of the ACC fronts and filaments. The path, width, and intensity of the frontal branches are influenced strongly by the bathymetry. The “meander envelopes” of the fronts are narrow on the northern slope of topographic ridges, where the sloping topography reinforces the beta effect, and broader over abyssal plains.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has received considerable attention, motivated by its major role in the global climate system. Observations of AMOC strength at 26°N made by the Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) array provide the best current estimate of the state of the AMOC. The period 2004–11 when RAPID AMOC is available is too short to assess decadal variability of the AMOC. This modeling study introduces a new AMOC index (called AMOCSV) at 26°N that combines the Florida Straits transport, the Ekman transport, and the southward geostrophic Sverdrup transport. The main hypothesis in this study is that the upper midocean geostrophic transport calculated using the RAPID array is also wind-driven and can be approximated by the geostrophic Sverdrup transport at interannual and longer time scales. This index is expected to reflect variations in the AMOC at interannual to decadal time scales. This estimate of the surface branch of the AMOC can be constructed as long as reliable measu...},

Sea level signals are decomposed into barotropic, steric, and inverted barometer contributions. Forcings are decomposed into surface winds, buoyancy fluxes, and Ekman pumping. Seasonal-to-interannual sea level variability in the low latitudes is governed almost entirely by the thermosteric response to wind forcing associated with tropical modes of climate variability. In the extratropics, changes to dynamic sea level associated with atmospheric modes of variability include a substantial barotropic response to wind forcing, particularly over the continental shelf seas. However, wind-driven steric changes are also important in some locations. On interannual time scales, wind-forced steric changes dominate, although heat and freshwater fluxes are important in the northwest Atlanti...},

For a demonstration, we evaluate two idealised flight transects derived from NASA's Operation IceBridge airborne ice surveys in terms of their potential to improve 10-day to 5-month sea ice forecasts. As target regions for the forecasts we select the Chukchi Sea, an area particularly relevant for maritime traffic and offshore resource exploration, as well as two areas related to the Barnett ice severity index (BSI), a standard measure of shipping conditions along the Alaskan coast that is routinely issued by ice services. Our analysis quantifies the benefits of sampling upstream of the target area and of reducing the sampling uncertainty. We demonstrate how observations of sea ice and snow thickness can constrain ice and snow variables in a target region and quantify the complementarity of combining two flight transects. We further quantify the benefit of improved atmospheric forecasts and a well-calibrated model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It affects the earth's climate on a global scale. Whether it is a cyclic or a sporadic event, or whether its apparently random behaviour can be explained by stochastic dynamics have remained matters of debate. Herein ENSO is viewed, unconventionally, as a two-dimensional dynamical system on a desktop. The main features of ENSO: irregularity, interannual variability, and the asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña are captured, simply, comprehensibly, quickly and cheaply, in a nonlinear stochastic limit cycle paradigm. Its predictability for ENSO compares remarkably well with that of the best state-of-the-art complex models from the European and American meteorological centres. Additionally, for the first time, by analyzing subsurface Equatorial Pacific data since 1960, this model finds that long-term variations are not caused by ENSO itself, but by external sources.},

Previously, a 12-yr increase, 1993 to 2004, in the circulation of the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre interior was described. That analysis was based on differences between early Argo and 1990s hydrographic data and changes in sea surface height. Here, it is shown that the trend of increasing circulation continues through 2014, with some differences within the Argo decade (2005 to 2014). Patterns that indicate or are consistent with increasing equatorward transport in the eastern portion of the South Pacific Gyre are seen in Argo temperature and steric height, Argo trajectory velocity, altimetric sea surface height, sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, and wind stress. Between 2005 and 2014 the geostrophic circulation across 35°S, from 160°W to South America, was enhanced by 5 Sv (1 Sv \${\textbackslash}equiv\$ 106 m3 s{\textbackslash}textminus1) of added northward flow.

	doi = {10.1038/ncomms6239},
	abstract = {In marine ecosystems, like most natural systems, patchiness is the rule. A characteristic of pelagic ecosystems is that their 'substrate' consists of constantly moving water masses, where ocean surface turbulence creates ephemeral oases. Identifying where and when hotspots occur and how predators manage those vagaries in their preyscape is challenging because wide-ranging observations are lacking. Here we use a unique data set, gathering high-resolution and wide-range acoustic and GPS-tracking data. We show that the upper ocean dynamics at scales less than 10 km play the foremost role in shaping the seascape from zooplankton to seabirds. Short internal waves (100 m-1 km) play a major role, while submesoscale ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde1-20 km) and mesoscale ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde20-100 km) turbulence have a comparatively modest effect. Predicted changes in surface stratification due to global change are expected to have an impact on the number and intensity of physical structures and thus biological interactions from plankton to top predators.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of Southern Ocean chlorophyll concentrations is the most effective way to detect large-scale changes in phytoplankton biomass driven by seasonality and climate change. However, the current algorithms for the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS, algorithm OC4v6), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua, algorithm OC3M), and GlobColour significantly underestimate chlorophyll concentrations at high latitudes. Here, we use a long-term data set from the Southern Ocean (20 degrees-160 degrees E) to develop more accurate algorithms for all three of these products in southern high-latitude regions. These new algorithms improve in situ versus satellite chlorophyll coefficients of determination (r(2)) from 0.27 to 0.46, 0.26 to 0.51, and 0.25 to 0.27, for OC4v6, OC3M, and GlobColour, respectively, while addressing the underestimation problem. This study also revealed that pigment composition, which reflects species composition and physiology, is key to understanding the reasons for satellite chlorophyll underestimation in this region. These significantly improved algorithms will permit more accurate estimates of standing stocks and more sensitive detection of spatial and temporal changes in those stocks, with consequences for derived products such as primary production and carbon cycling.},

	abstract = {Deep water formation in climate models is indicative of their ability to simulate future ocean circulation, carbon and heat uptake, and sea level rise. Present-day temperature, salinity, sea ice concentration and ocean transport in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas from 23 CMIP5 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5) models are compared with observations to assess the biases, causes and consequences of North Atlantic deep convection in models. The majority of models convect too deep, over too large an area, too often and too far south. Deep convection occurs at the sea ice edge and is most realistic in models with accurate sea ice extent, mostly those using the CICE model. Half of the models convect in response to local cooling or salinification of the surface waters; only a third have a dynamic relationship between freshwater coming from the Arctic and deep convection. The models with the most intense deep convection have the warmest deep waters, due to a redistribution of heat through the water column. For the majority of models, the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is explained by the volumes of deep water produced in the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas up to 2 years before. In turn, models with the strongest AMOC have the largest heat export to the Arctic. Understanding the dynamical drivers of deep convection and AMOC in models is hence key to realistically forecasting Arctic oceanic warming and its consequences for the global ocean circulation, cryosphere and marine life.},

[266][1], published 13 June) present detailed glaciological estimates of ice-shelf melting around the entire continent of Antarctica, which show that basal melting accounts for as much mass loss as does calving.

	abstract = {We investigate the interannual variability in the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean on the basis of hindcast simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological model with particular emphasis on the role of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The simulations are run under either pre-industrial or historical CO2 concentrations, permitting us to separately investigate natural, anthropogenic, and contemporary CO2 flux variability. We find large interannual variability (±0.19 PgC yr{\textbackslash}textminus1) in the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux from the Southern Ocean ({\textless}35°S). Forty-three percent of the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux variance is coherent with SAM, mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which SAM explains 48\%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yr{\textbackslash}textminus1 per standard deviation of the SAM. In contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at a rate of 0.01 PgC yr{\textbackslash}textminus1 during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of anthropogenic CO2 only slightly mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so that a positive SAM is associated with anomalous outgassing in contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2 outgassing is anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are primarily a result of the circulation changes associated with the southward shift and strengthening of the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM. The secular, positive trend in the SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern Ocean over the past 50 years.},

Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional d...},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean (SO) is a unique and dynamic component of the climate system. Due in part to its cold temperatures and large surface area, the SO is an important region for the transfer of heat, momentum, and climatically relevant gases between the atmosphere and the interior ocean. The strong westerly winds above the SO help drive a powerful current (i.e. the Antarctic Circumpolar Current or ACC) that connects Earth's ocean basins in a global overturning circulation. In recent decades, these winds have strengthened and shifted poleward. Despite this change in surface forcing, no clear observational signal of the oceanic density structure's response has yet been detected. The eddy compensation hypothesis posits that changes in the direct wind-driven overturning circulation are balanced by changes in the eddy-induced meridional circulation, effectively rendering SO stratification insensitive to wind stress. The closely related (but not identical) eddy saturation hypothesis suggests that the ACC is also insensitive to increased wind stress, since additional energy ends up in the mesoscale eddy field instead of in the zonal mean circulation. In this work, we examine the viability of the eddy compensation and saturation hypotheses on interannual, decadal, and centennial timescales. Using a combination of theory and idealized numerical simulations, we show that it may take the Southern Ocean many decades to centuries to fully equilibrate with the world ocean following a change in wind stress. As such, it may be difficult to detect changes in isopycnal slope using the few decades of available observational data. We also explore the characteristics of eddy-driven interannual variability and examine how this variability may affect the decadal-scale adjustment of the global ocean. Our results suggest that departures from the eddy compensation regime may be important on decadal and centennial timescales, on which the interaction between regional Southern Ocean circulation and global ocean circulation is significant. As such, we suggest that Southern Ocean overturning circulation is likely to strengthen in response to recent and future climate change, with implications for the global carbon cycle and climate.},

It has been proposed that observed changes in salinity can be used to infer changes in the water cycle. Here salinity is characterized by the distribution of water masses in salinity coordinates. Only mixing and sources and sinks of freshwater and salt can modify this distribution. Mixing acts to collapse the distribution, making saline waters fresher and fresh waters more saline. Hence, in steady state, there must be net precipitation over fresh waters and net evaporation over saline waters. A simple model is developed to describe the relationship between the breadth of the distribution, the water cycle, and mixing—the latter being characterized by an e-folding time scale. In both observations and a state-of-the-art ocean model, the water cycle maintains a salinity distribution in steady state with a mixing time scale of the order of 50 yr. The same simple model predicts the response of the salinity ...},

The well-posedness of the model which consists of a coupled ODE and PDE is shown for both the case with diffusion and without diffusion. Boundedness of solutions, the existence of an attractor, and an inertial manifold is proven, and an exact reduction to a low-dimensional model is obtained for the diffusion case. The reduced systems may have far fewer degrees of freedom than the reduction to the inertial manifold. For the three mode models, equivalence with the classical Lorenz equations is shown. Numerical results are presented for five mode models.},

This study evaluates finescale estimates derived from isopycnal strain by comparing them with average microstructure profiles from six diverse environments including the equator, above ridges, near seamounts, and in strong currents. The finescale strain estimates are derived from at least 10 nearby Argo profiles (generally {\textless}60 km distant) with no temporal restrictions, including measurements separated by seasons or decades. The absence of temporal limits is reasonable in these cases, since the authors find the dissipation rate is steady over seasonal time scales at the latitudes being considered (0°–30° and 40°–50°). In contrast, a seasonal cycle of a factor of 2–5 in the upper 1000 m is found under storm tracks (30°–40°) in both hemispheres.

Although the grounding lines of several Antarctic glaciers have retreated rapidly due to ocean-driven melting, records are too scarce to assess the scale of the imbalance. Here, we combine satellite altimeter observations of ice-elevation change and measurements of ice geometry to track grounding-line movement around the entire continent, tripling the coverage of previous surveys. Between 2010 and 2016, 22\%, 3\% and 10\% of surveyed grounding lines in West Antarctica, East Antarctica and at the Antarctic Peninsula retreated at rates faster than 25 m yr{\textbackslash}textminus1 (the typical pace since the Last Glacial Maximum) and the continent has lost 1,463 km2 ± 791 km2 of grounded-ice area. Although by far the fastest rates of retreat occurred in the Amundsen Sea sector, we show that the Pine Island Glacier grounding line has stabilized, probably as a consequence of abated ocean forcing. On average, Antarctica’s fast-flowing ice streams retreat by 110 metres per metre of ice thinning.},

At sufficiently high resolution, there is little or no sensitivity of circumpolar transport to wind stress, even in the limit of no wind. In contrast, the meridional overturning circulation continues to vary with Southern Ocean wind stress, but with reduced sensitivity in the limit of high wind stress. Both the circumpolar transport and meridional overturning continue to vary with diapycnal diffusivity at all model resolutions.

	title = {Observed associations among storm tracks, jet streams and midlatitude oceanic fronts},
	abstract = {An association is discussed among a midlatitude storm track, a westerly polar-front jet stream and an underlying oceanic frontal zone. Their close association is observed when a subtropical jet stream is weak, as in the Southern Hemisphere summer or in the North Atlantic. Along a near-surface baroclinic zone that tends to be anchored around a frontal zone, storm track activity is enhanced within a well-defined polar-front jet with modest core. velocity. This eddy-driven jet exhibits a deep structure with the strong surface westerlies maintained mainly through a poleward eddy heat flux. The westerly wind stress exerted along the frontal zone acts to maintain it by driving the oceanic current system, suggestive of a feedback loop via midlatitude atmosphere-ocean interaction. It is argued that the context of this feedback must be included in interpreting the tropospheric general circulation and its variability. In fact, decadal-scale sea-surface temperature anomalies observed in the North Pacific subarctic frontal zone controlled the anomalous heat release to the atmosphere. Seemingly, the local storm track responded consistently to the decadal-scale shift of the frontal axis, acting to reinforce basin-scale flow anomalies. Over the North and South Pacific, the association is disturbed in winter by an intensified subtropical jet that traps eddy activity into its sharp core. The trapping impairs baroclinic interaction of upper-level eddies with the surface baroclinicity along a midlatitude oceanic front, leading to the suppression of eddy activity as observed in midwinter over the North Pacific.},

Coupled model ensembles were integrated forward from each of 10 different start dates spanning from 1961 to 2006 with ocean and sea ice initial conditions obtained from a forced historical experiment, a Coordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiment with Interannual forcing (CORE-IA), which exhibits good correspondence with late twentieth-century ocean observations from the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) region. North Atlantic heat content anomalies from the DP ensemble correlate highly with those from the CORE-IA simulation after correcting for a drift bias. In particular, the observed large, rapid rise in SPG heat content in the mid-1990s is successfully predicted in the ensemble initialized in January of 1991. A budget of SPG heat con...},

The former is now accepted and modelling work has been used to support the latter, but until now no firm observational evidence has been offered in support of oceanic control of the atmosphere.

	abstract = {We describe computational aspects of automatic differentiation applied to global ocean circulation modeling and state estimation. The task of minimizing a cost function measuring the ocean simulation versus observation misfit is achieved through efficient calculation of the cost gradient w.r.t. a set of controls via the adjoint technique. The adjoint code of the parallel MIT general circulation model is generated using TAMC or its successor TAF. To achieve a tractable problem in both CPU and memory requirements, in the light of control flow reversal, the adjoint code relies heavily on the balancing of storing versus recomputation via the checkpointing method. Further savings are achieved by exploiting self-adjointness of part of the computation. To retain scalability of domain decomposition-based parallelism, hand-written adjoint routines are provided. These complement routines of the parallel support package to perform corresponding operations in reverse mode. The unique feature of the TAF tool which enables the dumping of the adjoint state and restart the adjoint integration is exploited to overcome batch execution limitations on HPC machines for large-scale ocean and climate simulations. Strategies to test the correctness of the adjoint-generated gradient are presented. The size of a typical adjoint application is illustrated for the case of the global ocean state estimation problem undertaken by the SIO-JPL-MIT Consortium “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean” (ECCO). Results are given by way of example.},

	abstract = {Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) drives the ongoing global warming and can best be assessed across the historical record (that is, since 1960) from ocean heat content (OHC) changes. An accurate assessment of OHC is a challenge, mainly because of insufficient and irregular data coverage. We provide updated OHC estimates with the goal of minimizing associated sampling error. We performed a subsample test, in which subsets of data during the data-rich Argo era are colocated with locations of earlier ocean observations, to quantify this error. Our results provide a new OHC estimate with an unbiased mean sampling error and with variability on decadal and multidecadal time scales (signal) that can be reliably distinguished from sampling error (noise) with signal-to-noise ratios higher than 3. The inferred integrated EEI is greater than that reported in previous assessments and is consistent with a reconstruction of the radiative imbalance at the top of atmosphere starting in 1985. We found that changes in OHC are relatively small before about 1980; since then, OHC has increased fairly steadily and, since 1990, has increasingly involved deeper layers of the ocean. In addition, OHC changes in six major oceans are reliable on decadal time scales. All ocean basins examined have experienced significant warming since 1998, with the greatest warming in the southern oceans, the tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean, and the tropical/subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This new look at OHC and EEI changes over time provides greater confidence than previously possible, and the data sets produced are a valuable resource for further study.},

In this study, we track the migratory movements of eight seabird species from across the Atlantic; quantify overlap with the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) and determine the habitat characteristics that drive this association. Our results indicate the CCLME is a biodiversity hotspot for migratory seabirds; all tracked species and more than 70\% of individuals used this upwelling region. Relative species richness peaked in areas where sea surface temperature averaged between 15 and 20°C, and correlated positively with chlorophyll a , revealing the optimum conditions driving bottom-up trophic effects for seabirds. Marine vertebrates are not confined by international boundaries, making conservation challenging. However, by linking diversity to ocean productivity, our research reveals the significance of the CCLME for seabird populations from across the Atlantic, making it a priority for conservation action.},

	abstract = {The study of long-distance migration provides insights into the habits and performance of organisms at the limit of their physical abilities. The Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea is the epitome of such behavior; despite its small size ({\textless}125 g), banding recoveries and at-sea surveys suggest that its annual migration from boreal and high Arctic breeding grounds to the Southern Ocean may be the longest seasonal movement of any animal. Our tracking of 11 Arctic terns fitted with miniature (1.4-g) geolocators revealed that these birds do indeed travel huge distances (more than 80,000 km annually for some individuals). As well as confirming the location of the main wintering region, we also identified a previously unknown oceanic stopover area in the North Atlantic used by birds from at least two breeding populations (from Greenland and Iceland). Although birds from the same colony took one of two alternative southbound migration routes following the African or South American coast, all returned on a broadly similar, sigmoidal trajectory, crossing from east to west in the Atlantic in the region of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone. Arctic terns clearly target regions of high marine productivity both as stopover and wintering areas, and exploit prevailing global wind systems to reduce flight costs on long-distance commutes.},

Thus the cool foggy summer conditions that typify the coastlands of northern California and other similar upwelling regions might, under global warming, become even more pronounced.

	abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been observed continuously at 26° N since April 2004. The AMOC and its component parts are monitored by combining a transatlantic array of moored instruments with submarine-cable-based measurements of the Gulf Stream and satellite derived Ekman transport. The time series has recently been extended to October 2012 and the results show a downward trend since 2004. From April 2008 to March 2012, the AMOC was an average of 2.7 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s?1) weaker than in the first four years of observation (95\% confidence that the reduction is 0.3 Sv or more). Ekman transport reduced by about 0.2 Sv and the Gulf Stream by 0.5 Sv but most of the change (2.0 Sv) is due to the mid-ocean geostrophic flow. The change of the mid-ocean geostrophic flow represents a strengthening of the southward flow above the thermocline. The increased southward flow of warm waters is balanced by a decrease in the southward flow of lower North Atlantic deep water below 3000 m. The transport of lower North Atlantic deep water slowed by 7\% per year (95\% confidence that the rate of slowing is greater than 2.5\% per year).},

These include provisioning of fishery products, nutrient cycling, climate regulation and the maintenance of biodiversity, with associated cultural and aesthetic benefits. Potential catch limits for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) alone are equivalent to 11\% of current global marine fisheries landings. We also examine the extent to which decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) considers trade-offs between ecosystem services, using the management of the Antarctic krill fishery as a case study. Management of this fishery considers a three-way trade-off between fisheries performance, the status of the krill stock and that of predator populations. However, there is a paucity of information on how well these components represent other ecosystem services that might be degraded as a result of fishing. There is also a lack of information on how beneficiaries value these ecosystem services. A formal ecosystem assessment would help to address these knowledge gaps. It could also help to harmonize decision-making across the ATS and promote global recognition of Southern Ocean ecosystem services by providing a standard inventory of the relevant ecosystem services and their value to beneficiaries.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.12.004},
	abstract = {Mesoscale processes play fundamental roles in the dynamics and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean. Previous modeling studies with coarse resolution models show varying estimates of carbon uptake there due to the differences in the representation of physical circulation and mesoscale processes. We develop a new eddy-permitting carbon cycle model of the Southern Ocean with improved representation of eddies, jets, and frontal structures. The model employs physical circulation fields from a Southern Ocean State Estimate: a model solution that is constrained by a suite of remotely sensed and in situ measurements to ensure realistic hydrographic structures and transport fields. A simple biogeochemistry model is coupled to the physical model to simulate the cycling of alkalinity, carbon, and nutrients. In this paper we compare simulated biogeochemical tracers with observations, and diagnose mechanisms controlling the regional carbon cycle. Model-data comparisons in Drake Passage and CLIVAR repeat sections provide tests for the model performance in capturing observed biogeochemical properties. Temporal variability of air-sea CO(2) flux is primarily controlled by surface pCO(2) on seasonal timescale, modulated by rapid fluctuations in surface wind speed on a shorter timescale. Analysis of simulated carbon transport indicates that the zonal mean circulation transports carbon southward, partly compensated by the northward stationary and transient eddy fluxes. Variability of zonal mean circulation, which is strongly correlated with Ekman transport, dominates the temporal variability of meridional carbon transport across the Polar Front.

Transfer functions between wind stress and SSH response are calculated and compared to previous work. It is found that (i) the response to local alongshore wind stress dominates on short time scales of O(1 day); (ii) the effect of nonlocal winds dominates on longer time scales and is carried by coastally trapped waves, as well as inertia–gravity waves for offshore wind stress; and (iii) there are significant seasonal variations in the sensitivity of SSH to wind stress due to changes in stratification.

	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies stimulate biological production in the ocean, but knowledge of energy transfers to higher trophic levels within eddies remains fragmented and not quantified. Increasing the knowledge base is constrained by the inability of traditional sampling methods to adequately sample biological processes at the spatio-temporal scales at which they occur. By combining satellite and acoustic observations over spatial scales of 10 s of km horizontally and 100 s of m vertically, supported by hydrographical and biological sampling we show that anticyclonic eddies shape distribution and density of marine life from the surface to bathyal depths. Fish feed along density structures of eddies, demonstrating that eddies catalyze energy transfer across trophic levels. Eddies create attractive pelagic habitats, analogous to oases in the desert, for higher trophic level aquatic organisms through enhanced 3-D motion that accumulates and redistributes biomass, contributing to overall bioproduction in the ocean. Integrating multidisciplinary observation methodologies promoted a new understanding of biophysical interaction in mesoscale eddies. Our findings emphasize the impact of eddies on the patchiness of biomass in the sea and demonstrate that they provide rich feeding habitat for higher trophic marine life.},

	doi = {10.1175/1520-0485(1999)029<0837:IDOASJ>2.0.CO;2},
	abstract = {The Azores front is associated with an eastward flowing subtropical jet, which coincides with the northern edge of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre and forms a southern branch of the Gulf Stream. An intensive study of the eddy-driven mean flow induced by the nonlinear instability of the jet has been conducted. Using a primitive equation numerical model initialized with the summer hydrological fields typical of the Azores front. the authors show that 1) the mesoscale patterns that appear after a few months are largely determined by baroclinic instability processes. 2) the jet and its associated mesoscale turbulence have a strong meridional asymmetry due to the strongly sloping thermocline. In general, an anticyclonic meander, which grows and deforms northwestward, generates a pinched-off anticyclone while a cyclonic meander, which grows and deforms southwestward, degenerates in a thin filamental structure that will dissipate before any cyclone can be pinched off. The authors propose a mechanism that relates this asymmetry of the turbulent fields to the mean meridional gradient of Ertel potential vorticity. 3) the rectification of the meridionally asymmetric mesoscale turbulent eddies is able to create a westward flowing countercurrent on the northern flank of the main jet. The Eliassen-Palm flux vector divergence or, equivalently, the turbulent transport of Ertel potential vorticity perturbation drives the countercurrent in the upper layers, while the Coriolis force acting over the ageostrophic meridional circulation is responsible at lower levels. This ageostrophic meridional circulation is dipolar, with an upwelling below the jet axis and downwellings on either sides. The dipole is forced by the particular structure of the eddy transport of zonal momentum associated with meridional asymmetry. It is an important communication link between the surface and deeper ocean layers in a frontal area. These results are in good agreement with observational data from the Azores Front system and are probably relevant to other zonal jets that lie on the poleward sides of subtropical gyres.},

	abstract = {We investigate the multidecadal and decadal trends in the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean using output from hindcast simulations of an ocean circulation model with embedded biogeochemistry. The simulations are run with NCEP-1 forcing under both preindustrial and historical atmospheric CO2 concentrations so that we can separately analyze trends in the natural and anthropogenic CO2 fluxes. We find that the Southern Ocean ({\textless}35°S) CO2 sink has weakened by 0.1 Pg C a{\textbackslash}textminus1 from 1979–2004, relative to the expected sink from rising atmospheric CO2 and fixed physical climate. Although the magnitude of this trend is in agreement with prior studies (Le Quéré et al., 2007), its size may not be entirely robust because of uncertainties associated with the trend in the NCEP-1 atmospheric forcing. We attribute the weakening sink to an outgassing trend of natural CO2, driven by enhanced upwelling and equatorward transport of carbon-rich water, which are caused by a trend toward stronger and southward shifted winds over the Southern Ocean (associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)). In contrast, the trend in the anthropogenic CO2 uptake is largely unaffected by the trend in the wind and ocean circulation. We regard this attribution of the trend as robust, and show that surface and interior ocean observations may help to solidify our findings. As coupled climate models consistently show a positive trend in the SAM in the coming century [e.g., Meehl et al., 2007], these mechanistic results are useful for projecting the future behavior of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

	abstract = {We investigated the simulated iron budget in ocean surface waters in the 1990s and 2090s using the Community Earth System Model version 1 and the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 future CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emission scenario. We assumed that exogenous iron inputs did not change during the whole simulation period; thus, iron budget changes were attributed solely to changes in ocean circulation and mixing in response to projected global warming, and the resulting impacts on marine biogeochemistry. The model simulated the major features of ocean circulation and dissolved iron distribution for the present climate. Detailed iron budget analysis revealed that roughly 70\% of the iron supplied to surface waters in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions is contributed by ocean circulation and mixing processes, but the dominant supply mechanism differed by region: upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific and vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean. For the 2090s, our model projected an increased iron supply to HNLC waters, even though enhanced stratification was predicted to reduce iron entrainment from deeper waters. This unexpected result is attributed largely to changes in gyre-scale circulations that intensified the advective supply of iron to HNLC waters. The simulated primary and export production in the 2090s decreased globally by 6 and 13\%, respectively, whereas in the HNLC regions, they increased by 11 and 6\%, respectively. Roughly half of the elevated production could be attributed to the intensified iron supply. The projected ocean circulation and mixing changes are consistent with recent observations of responses to the warming climate and with other Coupled Model Intercomparison Project model projections. We conclude that future ocean circulation has the potential to increase iron supply to HNLC waters and will potentially buffer future reductions in ocean productivity.},

	abstract = {Climate change will be the greatest threat to humanity and global ecosystems in the coming years, and there is a pressing need to understand and communicate the impacts of warming, across the perspectives of the natural and social sciences. Hoegh-Guldberg et al. review the climate change–impact literature, expanding on the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They provide evidence of the impacts of warming at 1°, 1.5°, and 2°C—and higher—for the physical system, ecosystems, agriculture, and human livelihoods. The benefits of limiting climate change to no more than 1.5°C above preindustrial levels would outweigh the costs. Science , this issue p. [eaaw6974][1] \#\#\# BACKGROUND The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was established in 1992 to pursue the “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interferences with the climate system.” Since 1992, five major climate change assessment cycles have been completed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These reports identified rapidly growing climate-related impacts and risks, including more intense storms, collapsing ecosystems, and record heatwaves, among many others. Once thought to be tolerable, increases in global mean surface temperature (GMST) of 2.0°C or higher than the pre-industrial period look increasingly unmanageable and hence dangerous to natural and human systems. The Paris Climate Agreement is the most recent attempt to establish international cooperation over climate change. This agreement, ratified or acceded to by 185 countries, was designed to bring nations together voluntarily to take ambitious action on mitigating climate change, while also developing adaptation options and strategies as well as guaranteeing the means of implementation (e.g., climate finance). The Agreement is aimed at “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.” Many unanswered questions regarding a 1.5°C target surround the feasibility, costs, and inherent risks to natural and human systems. Consequently, countries invited the IPCC to prepare a Special Report on “the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.” The Special Report was completed and approved by the 48th Session of the IPCC in October 2018. \#\#\# ADVANCES Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the next 0.5°C above today (which will take GMST from 1.0°C to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period) will involve greater risks per unit temperature than those seen in the last 0.5°C increase. This principle of “accelerating risk” is also likely to drive proportionally and possibly exponentially higher risk levels in the transition from 1.5°C to 2.0°C above the pre-industrial period. We argue that this is a consequence of impacts accelerating as a function of distance from the optimal temperature for an organism or an ecosystem process. Coral reefs, for example, often appear healthy right up until the onset of mass coral bleaching and mortality, which can then destroy a reef within a few months. This also explains the observation of “tipping points” where the condition of a group of organisms or an ecosystem can appear “healthy” right up to the point of collapse, suggesting caution in extrapolating from measures of ecosystem condition to predict the future. Information of this nature needs to be combined with an appreciation of organisms’ distance from their optimal temperature. Finally, we explore elements of the costs and benefits associated with acting in response to climate change, and come to the preliminary conclusion that restraining average global temperature to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period would be much less costly than the damage due to inaction on global climate change. \#\#\# OUTLOOK As an IPCC expert group, we were asked to assess the impact of recent climate change (1.0°C, 2017) and the likely impact over the next 0.5° to 1.0°C of additional global warming. At the beginning of this exercise, many of us were concerned that the task would be hindered by a lack of expert literature available for 1.5°C and 2.0°C warmer worlds. Although this was the case at the time of the Paris Agreement, it has not been our experience 4 years later. With an accelerating amount of peer-reviewed scientific literature since the IPCC Special Report Global Warming of 1.5°C , it is very clear that there is an even more compelling case for deepening commitment and actions for stabilizing GMST at 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period. ![Figure][2]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Climate change and nonlinear responses. ( A ) Reef-building corals can bleach, losing ( B ) dinoflagellate symbionts ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde10 mm across) and dying, thus exhibiting ( C ) a nonlinear response to impacts/risks from climate change. H (high) and VH (very high) are the confidence for transition from one impact/risk level to another: white, no climate change–related impacts; yellow, some detectable climate change impacts/risks; red, severe and widespread impacts/risks; purple, very high impacts/risks with significant irreversibility or persistence. CREDITS: [(A) AND (B)] O. HOEGH-GULDBERG; (C) THE IPCC SPECIAL REPORT GLOBAL WARMING OF 1.5°C , WITH PERMISSION FROM IPCC Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have led to a global mean surface temperature 1.0°C higher than during the pre-industrial period. We expand on the recent IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C and review the additional risks associated with higher levels of warming, each having major implications for multiple geographies, climates, and ecosystems. Limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2.0°C would be required to maintain substantial proportions of ecosystems and would have clear benefits for human health and economies. These conclusions are relevant for people everywhere, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the escalation of climate-related risks may prevent the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Buoyancy forcing accounts for most of the decadal variability in both the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the subpolar gyre circulation, and the key drivers of these basin-scale circulation changes are found to be the turbulent buoyancy fluxes: evaporation as well as the latent and sensible heat fluxes. These three fluxes account for almost all of the decadal AMOC variability in the North Atlantic, even when applied only over the Labrador Sea region.

Such combined runoff fields simultaneously reflect the numerical accuracy of the discharge measurements and preserve the spatial and temporal distribution of simulated runoff. Selected gauging stations from the World Meteorological Organization Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) data archive were geographically coregistered to a gridded simulated topological network at 30´ (longitude × latitude) spatial resolution (STN–30p). Interstation regions between gauging stations along the STN–30p network were identified, and annual interstation runoff was calculated. The annual interstation runoff was compared with outputs from WBM calculations, which were performed using long-term mean monthly climate forcings (air temperature and precipitation). The simulated runoff for each cell was multiplied by the ratio of observed to simulated runoff of the corresponding interstation region from the GRDC data set to create spatially distributed runoff fields at 30´ resolution. The resulting composite runoff fields (UNH/GRDC Composite Runoff Fields V1.0) are released to the scientific community along with intermediate data sets, such as station attributes and long-term monthly regimes of the selected gauging stations, the simulated topological network (STN–30p), STN–30p derived attributes for the selected stations, and gridded fields of the interstation regions along STN–30p. These data sets represent high-resolution fields that are of value to a broad range of water-related research, including terrestrial modeling, climate-atmosphere interactions, and global water resource assessments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the modern climate, the ocean below 2 km is mainly filled by waters sinking into the abyss around Antarctica and in the North Atlantic. Paleoproxies indicate that waters of North Atlantic origin were instead absent below 2 km at the Last Glacial Maximum, resulting in an expansion of the volume occupied by Antarctic origin waters. In this study we show that this rearrangement of deep water masses is dynamically linked to the expansion of summer sea ice around Antarctica. A simple theory further suggests that these deep waters only came to the surface under sea ice, which insulated them from atmospheric forcing, and were weakly mixed with overlying waters, thus being able to store carbon for long times. This unappreciated link between the expansion of sea ice and the appearance of a voluminous and insulated water mass may help quantify the ocean’s role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide on glacial–interglacial timescales. Previous studies pointed to many independent changes in ocean physics to account for the observed swings in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Here it is shown that many of these changes are dynamically linked and therefore must co-occur.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

During an El Niño event the Tropics warm at all longitudes and the subtropical jets in both hemispheres strengthen on their equatorward flanks. Poleward of the tropical warming there are latitude belts of marked cooling, extending from the surface to the tropopause in both hemispheres, at all longitudes and in all seasons. The midlatitude cooling is caused by changes in the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation.

	abstract = {Coastal upwelling along eastern boundaries has fascinated oceanographers for decades. The strong coupling between atmospheric forcing, ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycling, and food web dynamics encouraged oceanographers to conduct multidisciplinary scientific studies that have since become common. Following that tradition, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to highlight differences between the major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE‚Äôs). Ocean basin-scale settings are important determinants of EBUE characteristics. First, trade winds accumulate heat and mass in the western side of the basins, deepening the thermocline in the west and raising it in the east. Second, and especially prominent in the Pacific, these properties are redistributed eastwards on interannual and multidecadal time scales, reducing the characteristically high biological productivity found in the eastern basin margins. Thirdly, north‚Äìsouth patterns of thermocline doming on the equator and deepening in the subtropical gyres, and high latitude weather-driven mixing makes latitude an important characteristic of each EBUE. As such each EBUE has 3‚Äì4 well-defined latitudinally distributed biomes. Many enigmas remain regarding EBUE‚Äôs including: (1) Why do EBUE‚Äôs differ dramatically in fish but not in primary production? (2) What nutrients or other physical properties limit EBUE primary production? (3) What roles do subsurface oxygen minimum zones play in EBUE ecosystems? (4) What role do euphausiids play in the transfer of energy through EBUE food webs? (5) What are the roles of EBUE food webs in the biogeochemical cycling of elements? (6) How inter-connected are biomes of EBUE ecosystems? and (7) Most importantly for society, how will EBUE‚Äôs respond to climate and global change.},

These Southern Ocean upper-limb water masses ventilate the ocean interior, and changes in their properties have been related to climate change in numerous studies. Over time, the authors follow the low potential vorticity and salinity minimum layers describing SAMW and AAIW and find that the water column in the 2090s shifts to lighter densities by approximately 0.2 kg m{\textbackslash}textminus3. The model projects a reduction in the SAMW and AAIW annual mean subduction rates as a result of a combination of a shallower mixed layer, increased potential vorticity at the base of the mixed layer, and a net buoyancy gain. There is little change in the projected total volume of SAMW transported into the ocean interior via the subduction...},

TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data show that subpolar sea surface height increased during the 1990s, and the geostrophic velocity derived from altimeter data exhibits declining subpolar gyre circulation. Combining the data from earlier satellites, we find that subpolar circulation may have been weaker in the late 1990s than in the late 1970s and 1980s. Direct current-meter observations in the boundary current of the Labrador Sea support the weakening circulation trend of the 1990s and, together with hydrographic data, show that the mid- to late 1990s decline extends deep in the water column. Analysis of the local surface forcing suggests that the 1990s buoyancy forcing has a dynamic effect consistent with altimetric and hydrographic observations: A weak thermohaline forcing allows the decay of the domed structure of subpolar isopycnals and weakening of circulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has increased in recent decades, suggestive of sustained ocean forcing or an ongoing, possibly unstable, response to a past climate anomaly. Lengthening satellite records appear to be incompatible with either process, however, revealing both periodic hiatuses in acceleration and intermittent episodes of thinning. Here we use ocean temperature, salinity, dissolved-oxygen and current measurements taken from 2000 to 2016 near the Dotson Ice Shelf to determine temporal changes in net basal melting. A decadal cycle dominates the ocean record, with melt changing by a factor of about four between cool and warm extremes via a nonlinear relationship with ocean temperature. A warm phase that peaked around 2009 coincided with ice-shelf thinning and retreat of the grounding line, which re-advanced during a post-2011 cool phase. These observations demonstrate how discontinuous ice retreat is linked with ocean variability, and that the strength and timing of decadal extremes is more influential than changes in the longer-term mean state. The nonlinear response of melting to temperature change heightens the sensitivity of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to such variability, possibly explaining the vulnerability of the ice sheet in that sector, where subsurface ocean temperatures are relatively high.},

	abstract = {AbstractA coupled ice-ocean eddy-permitting Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) for 2008-2010 is used to describe and quantify the processes forming and destroying water in the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) density range (σ?=26.7 ? 27.2 kg m-3). All the terms in the temperature and salinity equations have been diagnosed to obtain a three dimensional and time varying volume budget for individual isopycnal layers. We find that air-sea buoyancy fluxes, diapycnal mixing, advection, and storage are all important to the SAMW volume budget.The formation and destruction of water in the SAMW density range occurs over a large latitude range due to the seasonal migration of the outcrop window. The strongest formation is by wintertime surface ocean heat loss occurring equatorward of the Subantarctic Front. Spring and summertime formation occur in the polar gyres by freshening of water with σ? {\textgreater} 27.2 kg m-3, with an important contribution from sea ice melt. Further buoyancy gain by heating is accomplished only after these waters have already been transformed into the SAMW density range. The spatially integrated and time-averaged SAMW formation rate in the ocean surface layer is 7.9 Sv by air-sea buoyancy fluxes and 8.8 Sv by diapycnal mixing, and it is balanced by advective export into the interior ocean. These average rates are the result of highly variable processes with strong cancellation in both space and time. In this work we map the spatiotemporal structure of the formation and evolution processes that must be represented in climate models in order to properly represent the three-dimensional Southern Ocean overturning circulation.},

	doi = {10.5194/tc-7-407-2013},
	abstract = {Full Stokes flow-line models predict that fast-flowing ice streams transmit information about their bedrock topography most efficiently to the surface for basal undulations with length scales between 1 and 20 times the mean ice thickness. This typical behaviour is independent of the precise values of the flow law and sliding law exponents, and should be universally observable. However, no experimental evidence for this important theoretical prediction has been obtained so far, hence ignoring an important test for the physical validity of current-day ice flow models. In our work we use recently acquired airborne radar data for the Rutford Ice Stream and Evans Ice Stream, and we show that the surface response of fast-flowing ice is highly sensitive to bedrock irregularities with wavelengths of several ice thicknesses. The sensitivity depends on the slip ratio, i.e. the ratio between mean basal sliding velocity and mean deformational velocity. We find that higher values of the slip ratio generally lead to a more efficient transfer, whereas the transfer is significantly dampened for ice that attains most of its surface velocity by creep. Our findings underline the importance of bedrock topography for ice stream dynamics on spatial scales up to 20 times the mean ice thickness. Our results also suggest that local variations in the flow regime and surface topography at this spatial scale cannot be explained by variations in basal slipperiness.},

However, observations of decadal trends in Antarctic ice thickness, and hence ice volume, do not currently exist.

The model successfully reproduces observations of mean ice concentration, thickness, and drift, and decadal trends in ice concentration and drift, imparting some confidence in the hindcasted trends in ice thickness. The model suggests that overall Antarctic sea ice volume has increased by approximately 30 km3 yr{\textbackslash}textminus1 (0.4\% yr{\textbackslash}textminus1) as an equal result of areal expansion (20 × 103 km2 yr{\textbackslash}textminus1 or 0.2\% yr{\textbackslash}textminus1) and thickening (1.5 mm yr{\textbackslash}textminus1 or 0.2\% yr{\textbackslash}textminus1).

Furthermore, the cooling can extend to the entire southern extratropical and tropical oceans coupled with an intensification of southeasterly trades and the equatorial trade winds. Some modest warm anomalies also occur in the northern extratropical oceans, forming a sharp interhemispheric SST contrast.

	abstract = {Abstract Height coordinate ocean models commonly represent topography as a “staircase” of discontinuous steps that are fitted to the model grid. Here the ramifications of an alternative approach are studied in which “shaved cells” are used to represent irregular topography. The problem is formulated using the finite-volume method and care is taken to ensure that the discrete forms have appropriate conservation properties. Two representations of topography, “partial step” and “piecewise linear,” are considered and compared with the staircase approach in some standard problems such as the topographic β effect and flow over a Gaussian bump. It is shown that shaved cells are clearly more accurate than the conventional staircase representation. The use of partial steps, although not as accurate as the piecewise linear approach, is seen to be superior to the staircase approach. Moreover, partial steps can be readily implemented in existing height coordinate models.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the overturning circulation in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region shows a weak sensitivity to overlying wind stress changes, due to balancing of changes in the eddy-induced and Eulerian mean transports. Using an eddy-permitting coupled climate model, we analyze the response of the ACC transport, and associated water mass subduction rates, in response to an idealized poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies. As in previous studies, we find a small increase in the net ACC transport, and a poleward shift in the mean position of the ACC flow. However, the ACC is restructured, with the Subantarctic Front (SAF) and Polar Front (PF) branches shifting poleward by between 0.9 degrees and 2.5 degrees of latitude, resulting in a weaker ACC flow in both the SAF and PF zones. The wind stress anomaly drives a stronger northward Ekman transport of cool surface waters, deepening the winter mixed layer and causing a 12.7 Sv increase in the subduction of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) north of the SAF zone and a 6.5 Sv increase in the subduction of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) within the SAF and PF zones. Our results suggest that changes in the wind stress restructure the Southern Ocean large-scale circulation, including the flow of the ACC in its primary jets, and that this affects the formation rates of SAMW and AAIW in this complex region.

The ocean also has taken up about 27\% of anthropogenic carbon, resulting in acidification of the upper ocean. Increased stratification has resulted in a decline in oxygen and increase in nutrients in the Northern Hemisphere thermocline and an expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones. Southern Hemisphere thermocline oxygen increased in the 2000s owing to stronger wind forcingand ventilation.

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the model by Gnanadesikan [1999] for the pycnocline depth in the ocean. An analytic solution for the overturning strength as a function of the meridional pressure difference is derived and used to discuss their mutual scaling. We show that scaling occurs only in two unphysical regimes of the model. In the absence of the Southern Ocean (SO) processes, i.e. for a northern overturning cell, the volume transport is proportional to the square root of the pressure difference. Linear scaling is seen when the overturning is restricted entirely to the SO, i.e. when no northern downwelling exists. For comparison, we present simulations with the coupled climate model CLIMBER-3α which show linear scaling over a large regime of pressure differences in the North Atlantic (NA). We conclude that the pycnocline model is not able to reproduce the linear scaling between its two central variables, pressure and volume transport.},

The thermodynamic cycle encapsulates a globally interconnected heat and water cycle comprising ascent of moist air where latent heat is converted into dry static energy, radiative cooling where dry air loses dry static energy, and a moistening branch where air is warmed and moistened. It approximately follows a tropical moist adiabat and is bounded by the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship for near-surface air.

The proxy data were simulated by drawing data from four different model simulations at the ocean sediment core locations of the Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean surface (MARGO) project, and perturbing these data with realistic noise estimates. The results suggest that our method has the potential to provide estimates of the past strength of the AMOC even from sparse data, but in general, paleo-sea-surface temperature data without additional prior knowledge about the ocean state during the LGM is not adequate to constrain the model. On the one hand, additional data in the deep-ocean and salinity data are shown to be highly important in estimating the LGM circulation. On the other hand, increasing the amount of surface data alone does not appear to be enough for better estimates. Finally, better initial guesses to start the state estimation procedure would greatly improve the performance of the method. Indeed, with a sufficiently good first guess, just the sea-surface temperature data from the MARGO project promise to be sufficient for reliable estimates of the strength of the AMOC.},

	abstract = {Mass loss from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica account for a large fraction of global sea-level rise. Part of this loss is because of the effects of warmer air temperatures, and another because of the rising ocean temperatures to which they are being exposed. Joughin et al. (p. [1172][1]) review how ocean-ice interactions are impacting ice sheets and discuss the possible ways that exposure of floating ice shelves and grounded ice margins are subject to the influences of warming ocean currents. Estimates of the mass balance of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have differed greatly—in some cases, not even agreeing about whether there is a net loss or a net gain—making it more difficult to project accurately future sea-level change. Shepherd et al. (p. [1183][2]) combined data sets produced by satellite altimetry, interferometry, and gravimetry to construct a more robust ice-sheet mass balance for the period between 1992 and 2011. All major regions of the two ice sheets appear to be losing mass, except for East Antarctica. All told, mass loss from the polar ice sheets is contributing about 0.6 millimeters per year (roughly 20\% of the total) to the current rate of global sea-level rise.

	abstract = {A stochastic model of atmospheric surface conditions, developed from 30 years of data at Ocean Weather Station P in the northeast Pacific, is used to drive a mixed layer model of the upper ocean. The spectral characteristics of anomalies in the four atmospheric variables; air and dewpoint temperature, wind speed and solar radiation, and many ocean features, including the seasonal cycle are reasonably well reproduced in a 500-year model simulation. However, the ocean model slightly underestimates the range of the mean and standard deviation of both temperature and mixed layer depth over the course of the year. The spectrum of the monthly SST anomalies from the model simulation are in close agreement with observations, especially when atmospheric forcing associated with El Nino is included. The spectral characteristics of the midlatitude SST anomalies is consistent with stochastic climate theory proposed by Frankignoul and Hasselmann (1977) for periods up to similar to 6 months.Lead/lag correlations and composites indicate a clear connection between the observed SST anomalies in spring and the following fall, as anomalous warm or cold water created in the deep mixed layer during winter/spring remain below the shallow mixed layer in summer and is then reentrained into the surface layer in the following fall and winter. This re-emergence mechanism also occurs in the model but the temperature anomaly pattern is more diffuse and influences the surface layer over a longer period compared with observations.A detailed analysis of the simulated mixed layer temperature tendency indicates that the anomalous net surface heat flux plays an important role in the growth of SST anomalies throughout the year and is the dominant term during winter. Entrainment of water into the mixed layer from below strongly influences SST anomalies in fall when the mixed layer is relatively shallow and thus has little thermal inertia. Mixed layer depth anomalies are highly correlated with the anomalous surface mechanical mixing in summer and surface buoyancy forcing in winter.},

Buttressing effects are analysed for a situation where a stable grounding line is located on a bed sloping upwards in the direction of flow. Such grounding-line positions are known to be unconditionally unstable in the absence of transverse flow variations. It is shown that ice-shelf buttressing can restore stability under these conditions. Ice flux at the grounding line is, in general, not a monotonically increasing function of ice thickness. This, possibly at first somewhat counterintuitive result, is found to be fully consistent with recent theoretical work. Grounding lines on retrograde slopes are conditionally stable, and the stability regime is a non-trivial function of bed and ice-shelf geometry. The stability of grounding lines cannot be assessed from considerations of local bed slope only.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jmarsys.2008.11.022},
	abstract = {During the last 30¬{\textbackslash}dagyears, at-sea studies of seabirds and marine mammals in the oceans south of the Subtropical Front have described an association with major frontal areas. More recently, the advancement in microtechnology has allowed the tracking of individuals and investigations into how these marine predators actually use the frontal zones. In this review, we examine 1) the relative importance to apex predators of the different frontal zones in terms of spatial distribution and carbon flux; 2) the processes that determine their preferential use; and 3) how the mesoscale dynamics of frontal structures drive at-sea foraging strategies of these predators. We review published results from southern waters and place them in a broader context with respect to what has been learned about the importance of fronts in oceans farther north. Some fronts constitute important boundaries for seabird communities in southern waters. At a mesoscale the maximum values of seabird diversity and abundance correspond to the location of the main fronts. At-sea surveys show a strong curvilinear correlation between seabird abundance and sea surface temperatures. High mean species richness and diversity for whales and seabirds are consistently associated with the southern water mass boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Subtropical Front and the Subantarctic Front; in the case of the Polar Front mean seabird densities are more variable. At small-scales, variation in seabird occurrence has been directly related to the processes at fronts in a limited number of cases. A significant positive relation was found between some plankton feeding species and frontal temperature gradient‚Äìphytoplankton variables. Telemetric studies have revealed that several apex predators (penguins, albatrosses, seals) perform long, directed foraging trips either to the Subtropical front or Polar Front, depending on locality. Seabirds with low flight costs, such as albatrosses, are able to reach fronts at long distances from colonies, showing variable foraging strategies as a function of the distances involved. Diving birds such as King penguins, that travel at a higher cost and lower speed, rely on the predictable spatial distribution of mesopelagic fish found close to the Polar Front. They may use the currents associated with eddies as oceanographic cues in the active search for frontal zones. Once in these areas they dive preferentially in and below the depth of the thermocline where catches per unit effort are high. Elephant seals concentrate foraging activity principally inside or at the boundary of cyclonic eddies. These mesoscale features appear to offer exceptional productivity favourable for foraging by various diving top predators. The connection between biophysical parameters at fronts and predators is likely to be made through biological enhancement. Top predators appear to forage at locations where prey are advected by physical processes and others where prey are produced locally. Long-term research on at-sea distributions and demographic parameters of top predators are essential to assess the consequences of potential shift in front distributions in relation to global warming. Such environmental changes would add to the impact of fish extraction by the industrial fisheries on the southern food webs.},

This analysis of sea surface temperatures (SST) and global teleconnections shows that SSTs are significantly spatially correlated with both the Antarctic Oscillation and the Southern Oscillation, with spatial correlations between the indices and standardized SST anomalies approaching 1.0. Here, we report that the recent positive patterns in the Antarctic and Southern Oscillations are driving negative (cooling) trends in SST in the high latitude Southern Ocean and positive (warming) trends within the Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics and mid-latitudes. The coefficient of regression over the 35-year period analyzed implies that standardized temperatures have warmed at a rate of 0.0142 per year between 1982 and 2016 with a monthly standard error in the regression of 0.0008. Further regression calculations between the indices and SST indicate strong seasonality in response to changes in atmospheric circulation, with the strongest feedback occurring throughout the austral summer and autumn.},

This note corrects this statement by demonstrating that the Mellor–Yamada mixing scheme, if implemented correctly, tends to overestimate rather than underestimate vertical mixing in seasonally ice-covered seas. Similar to other mixing schemes with the same behaviour, this leads to spurious open ocean deep convection, an unrealistic homogenization of the water column, and a significant reduction of sea ice volume.},

We begin with a review of methodologies used to advance our understanding of the trophodynamics of marine top predators, particularly in relation to climate change. We then explore how these developments are informing our understanding of the major trophic groups in food webs leading to, and including, marine top predators. We examine through specific examples how the impacts of ocean warming may affect pelagic food web relationships from both top-down and bottom-up perspectives. We examine the potential, in the absence of long-term data sets, of using large-scale spatial studies to examine how potential changes in biological oceanography could impact the biomass and composition of prey species, particularly the role of phytoplankton size spectra. We focus on examples from regions where biotic change with respect to climate change is likely. In particular, we detail the effects of climate change on oceanographic and bathymetric ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù and provide the example involving seabirds in the Benguela Current system. We end by urging the development of international collaborations and databases to facilitate comprehensive ocean-scale understanding of climate impacts on marine top predators.},

	title = {Seabird digestive physiology in relation to foraging ecology},
	url = {https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/21813},
	abstract = {This study addresses the question: are seabirds digestive opportunists or specialists? The extent of specialization in seabird digestive processes to different diets and foraging methods, is investigated experimentally. Gut passage rates of different food types of tested in vitro digestibility may reflect dietary specialization, with favoured prey types excreted more rapidly than less frequently encountered prey. Mean retention times of solid digesta are significantly correlated with foraging trip duration, and with gut length. Gut length and volume in tum scale with body mass. Assimilation efficiencies of various dietary components are not predictable purely on the basis of food composition, and show a high degree of inter- and intraspecific variability. Energy assimilation efficiency does not reflect dietary specialization, and may be maintained at approximately 75\% regardless of diet. Assimilation efficiency is, however, temporarily elevated in energetically-stressed birds, such as penguins that have recently completed moult. Digestive specializations are reflected in seabirds' abilities to assimilate substances specific to certain prey organisms. Unlike most terrestrial vertebrates, seabirds are able to digest wax esters, compounds important in marine food webs. Procellariiforms exhibit unique gastric adaptations facilitating extended foraging trips and efficient transport of food to their young, both important advantages for predators exploiting patchy and unpredictable food resources. Seabirds which naturally feed on crustaceans secrete the specific enzyme chitinase from their gastric mucosae, permitting digestion of the chitinous exoskeleton of the prey. The ability to secrete this enzyme is probably a retained ancestral trait rather than a newly evolved one, and may have been lost by seabirds that do not prey on crustaceans. Differences between penguins and procellarids reflect unique adaptations to the different foraging techniques employed by these two families. The synthesis of the thesis explores the adaptive significance of gut passage rate and allometry of the gut in relation to the two predominant foraging techniques employed by seabirds: long- distance aerial soaring and subsurface swimming. Scaling of seabird gut size may play an important role in the interplay between metabolic rate, the energy demands of foraging, and digestive physiology. The allometric approach taken here is potentially useful for studies of seabird digestion, and has application in studies linking the evolution of avian body size, and foraging ecology.},

	doi = {10.1357/002224007780388694},
	abstract = {High-resolution Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) observations of surface-layer velocities in Drake Passage, comprising 128 sections over a period of 5 years, are used to study the surface-layer circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). These observations resolve details of the mean flow including the topographic control of the mean Subantarctic Front (SAF) and the multiple filaments of the Polar Front (PF) and Southern ACC Front (SACCF) that converge into single mean jets as the ACC flows through Drake Passage. Subsurface definitions of the SAF and PF applied to expendable bathythermograph temperatures generally coincide with mean jets, while the SACCF is better defined in velocity than temperature. The mean transport in the top 250-m-deep surface layer, estimated from the cross-track transport along three repeat tracks, is 27.8 +/- 1 Sv. Eddy momentum fluxes were estimated by ensemble averaging Reynolds stresses relative to gridded Eulerian mean currents. Eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is surface intensified in the mixed layer because of inertial currents and decreases poleward in Drake Passage, ranging from similar to 800 cm(2) s(-2) to similar to 200 cm(2) s(-2). ADCP EKE estimates are everywhere significantly higher than altimetric EKE estimates, although the pattern of poleward decrease is the same. Horizontal-wavenumber spectra of velocity fluctuations peak at wavelengths in the 250-330 km range and are significantly anisotropic. Along-passage fluctuations dominate at wavelengths less than 250 km; cross-passage fluctuations dominate at wavelengths greater than 250 km. Mesoscale eddies dominate the variance in northern Drake Passage. Inertial variability is constant with latitude and together with baroclinic tides accounts for some but not all of the discrepancy between the ADCP surface-layer EKE and altimetry-inferred EKE.},

Although such an event is considered unlikely, to predict the consequences of collapse it is important to know how much sea level would rise in such a case. The WAIS is thought to contain enough ice to raise sea level by 5 to 7 meters were it to collapse. \textbf{Bamber \textit{et al.}} (p. 901, see the cover; see the Perspective by \textbf{Ivins}) have reassessed that number, on the basis of better data on the geometry of the WAIS, and conclude that its sudden collapse would raise sea level by about 3.2 meters, on average, with large and important regional variations. Although this is only about half as much as previously thought, its impact on coastal areas would still be devastating.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Pelagic marine predators face unprecedented challenges and uncertain futures. Overexploitation and climate variability impact the abundance and distribution of top predators in ocean ecosystems. Improved understanding of ecological patterns, evolutionary constraints and ecosystem function is critical for preventing extinctions, loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystem services. Recent advances in electronic tagging techniques have provided the capacity to observe the movements and long-distance migrations of animals in relation to ocean processes across a range of ecological scales. Tagging of Pacific Predators, a field programme of the Census of Marine Life, deployed 4,306 tags on 23 species in the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in a tracking data set of unprecedented scale and species diversity that covers 265,386 tracking days from 2000 to 2009. Here we report migration pathways, link ocean features to multispecies hotspots and illustrate niche partitioning within and among congener guilds. Our results indicate that the California Current large marine ecosystem and the North Pacific transition zone attract and retain a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates. Within the California Current large marine ecosystem, several predator guilds seasonally undertake north-south migrations that may be driven by oceanic processes, species-specific thermal tolerances and shifts in prey distributions. We identify critical habitats across multinational boundaries and show that top predators exploit their environment in predictable ways, providing the foundation for spatial management of large marine ecosystems.},

The characteristics of the deep water brought to the surface by upwelling favorable winds depend on the large-scale circulation patterns. Here we use a new hydrographic and nutrient climatology together with satellite measurements of the wind vector, sea-surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration, and primary production modeled from ocean color to quantify the meridional and seasonal patterns of upwelling dynamics and biological response. The unprecedented combination of data sets allows us to describe objectively the variability for small regions within each current and to characterize the governing factors for biological production. The temporal and spatial environmental variability was due in most regions to large-scale circulation, alone or in combination with offshore transport (local forcing). The observed meridional and seasonal patterns of biomass and primary production were most highly correlated to components representing large-scale circulation. The biomass sustained by a given nutrient concentration in the Atlantic EBCs was twice as large as that of the Pacific EBCs. This apparent greater efficiency may be due to availability of iron, physical retention, or differences in planktonic community structure.},

The model state at the termination of a measurement window acts as an initial condition for predicting the future behavior of the network. This allows the validation (or invalidation) of the model as a representation of the dynamical processes producing the observations.

Here, the technicalities of implementing the parameterization in the coarse-resolution ocean component of global climate models are made explicit, and the primary impacts on model solutions of implementing the parameterization are discussed. Three global ocean general circulation models including this parameterization are contrasted with control simulations lacking the parameterization. The {\textbackslash}MLE{\textbackslash} parameterization behaves as expected and fairly consistently in models differing in discretization, boundary layer mixing, resolution, and other parameterizations. The primary impact of the parameterization is a shoaling of the mixed layer, with the largest effect in polar winter regions. Secondary impacts include strengthening the Atlantic meridional overturning while reducing its variability, reducing {\textbackslash}CFC{\textbackslash} and tracer ventilation, modest changes to sea surface temperature and air–sea fluxes, and an apparent reduction of sea ice basal melting.},

	abstract = {The baroclinically unstable wind-and buoyancy-driven flow in a zonally reentrant pie-shaped sector on a sphere is numerically modeled and then analyzed using the transformed Eulerian-mean (TEM) formalism. Mean fields are obtained by zonal and time averaging performed at fixed height. The very large latitudinal extent of the basin (50.7 degrees S latitude to the equator) allows the latitude variation of the Coriolis parameter to strongly influence the flow. Persistent zonal jets are observed in the statistically steady state. Reynolds stress terms play an important role in redistributing zonal angular momentum: convergence of the lateral momentum flux gives rise to a strong eastward jet, with an adjacent westward jet equatorward and weaker multiple jets poleward. An equally prominent feature of the flow is a strong and persistent eddy that has the structure of a Kelvin cat's eye and generally occupies the zonal width of the basin at latitudes 15 degrees-10 degrees S. A strongly mixed surface diabatic zone overlies the near-adiabatic interior, within which Ertel potential vorticity (but not thickness) is homogenized along the mean isopycnals everywhere in the basin where eddies have developed (and thus is not homogenized equatorward of the most energetic eastward jet). A region of low potential vorticity (PV) is formed adjacent to the strong baroclinic front associated with that jet and subsequently maintained by strong convective events. The eddy buoyancy flux is dominated by its skew component over large parts of the near-adiabatic interior, with cross-isopycnal components present only in the vicinity of the main jet and in the surface diabatic layer. Close to the main jet, the cross-isopycnal components are dominantly balanced by the triple correlation terms in the buoyancy variance budget, while the advection of buoyancy variance by the mean flow is not a dominant term in the eddy buoyancy variance budget. Along-isopycnal mixing in the near-adiabatic interior is estimated by applying the effective diffusivity diagnostic of Nakamura. The effective diffusivity is large at the flanks of the mean jet and beneath it and small in the jet core. The apparent horizontal diffusivity for buoyancy obtained from the flux-gradient relationship is the same magnitude as the effective diffusivity, but the structures are rather different. The diapycnal diffusivity is strongest in the surface layer and also in a convectively unstable region that extends to depths of hundreds of meters beneath the equatorward flank of the main jet.},

Here we argue that recent advances across conservation, oceanography and fisheries science provide the evidence, tools and information to address these criticisms and confirm MPAs as defensible and feasible instruments for pelagic conservation.

	abstract = {AbstractThe suggestion is advanced that the remarkably low static stability of Antarctic surface waters may arise from a feedback loop involving global deep-water temperatures. If deep-water temperatures are too warm, this promotes Antarctic convection, thereby strengthening the inflow of Antarctic Bottom Water into the ocean interior and cooling the deep ocean. If deep waters are too cold, this promotes Antarctic stratification allowing the deep ocean to warm because of the input of North Atlantic Deep Water. A steady-state deep-water temperature is achieved such that the Antarctic surface can barely undergo convection. A two-box model is used to illustrate this feedback loop in its simplest expression and to develop basic concepts, such as the bounds on the operation of this loop. The model illustrates the possible dominating influence of Antarctic upwelling rate and Antarctic freshwater balance on global deep-water temperatures.},

	abstract = {We examine the annular mode within each hemisphere (defined here as the leading empirical orthogonal function and principal component of hemispheric sea level pressure) as simulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ensembles of coupled ocean-atmosphere models. The simulated annular patterns exhibit a high spatial correlation with the observed patterns during the late 20th century, though the mode represents too large a percentage of total temporal variability within each hemisphere. In response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols, the multimodel average exhibits a positive annular trend in both hemispheres, with decreasing sea level pressure (SLP) over the pole and a compensating increase in midlatitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trend agrees in sign but is of smaller amplitude than that observed during recent decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, decreasing stratospheric ozone causes an additional reduction in Antarctic surface pressure during the latter half of the 20th century. While annular trends in the multimodel average are positive, individual model trends vary widely. Not all models predict a decrease in high-latitude SLP, although no model exhibits an increase. As a test of the models' annular sensitivity, the response to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is calculated during the winter following five major tropical eruptions. The observed response exhibits coupling between stratospheric anomalies and annular variations at the surface, similar to the coupling between these levels simulated elsewhere by models in response to increasing GHG concentration. The multimodel average is of the correct sign but significantly smaller in magnitude than the observed annular anomaly. This suggests that the models underestimate the coupling of stratospheric changes to annular variations at the surface and may not simulate the full response to increasing GHGs.},

Part of this loss is because of the effects of warmer air temperatures, and another because of the rising ocean temperatures to which they are being exposed. Joughin et al. (p. [1172][1]) review how ocean-ice interactions are impacting ice sheets and discuss the possible ways that exposure of floating ice shelves and grounded ice margins are subject to the influences of warming ocean currents. Estimates of the mass balance of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have differed greatly—in some cases, not even agreeing about whether there is a net loss or a net gain—making it more difficult to project accurately future sea-level change. Shepherd et al. (p. [1183][2]) combined data sets produced by satellite altimetry, interferometry, and gravimetry to construct a more robust ice-sheet mass balance for the period between 1992 and 2011. All major regions of the two ice sheets appear to be losing mass, except for East Antarctica. All told, mass loss from the polar ice sheets is contributing about 0.6 millimeters per year (roughly 20\% of the total) to the current rate of global sea-level rise.

	doi = {10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2008.05.002},
	abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is composed of three major fronts: the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), the Polar Front (PF), the Southern ACC Front (SACCF). The locations of these fronts are variable. The PF can shift away from its historical (mean) location by as much as 100 km. The transport of the ACC in Drake Passage varies from its mean (134 Sv) by as much as 60 Sv. A regional numerical circulation model is used to study frontal variability in Drake Passage as affected by a range of volume transports (from 95 Sv to 155 Sv with an interval of 10 Sv). Large transport shifts the fronts northward while the smaller transport causes a southward shift. The mean shifting distance of the PF from the historical mean location is minimum with 135 Sv transport. The SAF and the SACCF are confined by northern and southern walls, respectively, while the PF is loosely controlled by the topography. Due to impact of the eddies and meanders on the PF at several regions in Drake Passage, the PF may move northward to join the SAF or move southward to combine with the SACCF, especially in central Scotia Sea. The SAF and PF are more stable with higher transport. The SAF behaves as a narrow, strong frontal jet with large transport while displaying meanders with smaller transport. In the model simulations, the Ertel Potential Vorticity (EPV) is strongly correlated with the volume transport stream function. EPV at depths between 1000 and 2500 m is correlated with the transport stream function with a coefficient above 0.9. Near the bottom, the correlation is about 0.6 due to the disruptive influence of bottom topography. Within 750 m of the surface, the correlation is much reduced due to the effect of K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) mixing and eddy mixing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Anomalies in (linear) advective heat transport convergences, as well as Ekman and geostrophic contributions, are decomposed into parts that are due to velocity variability, temperature variability, and their covariability. Ekman convergences are generally dominated by variability in Ekman mass transports, which reflect the instantaneous response to local wind forcing, except in the tropics, where variability in the temperature field plays a significant role. In contrast, both budget analyses and simple dynamical arguments demonstrate that geostrophic heat transport convergences that are due to temperature and velocity variability are anticorrelated, and thus t...},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) are used to study the initial spin-up and the evolution of a mesoscale, topographically linked eddy under steady and variable wind conditions. The development of a pool of dense water on the southern Vancouver Island shelf allows cyclonic eddies formed by coastal upwelling off Cape Flattery to spread westward, ultimately contributing to the shelf-wide circulation known as the Juan de Fuca Eddy. This dense water arises through upwelling of water present in the underlying canyon system and tidal mixing over several shallow banks to the north. Tidal mixing is critical to the separation of the eddy from the coast. Although steady upwelling winds with a seasonal mean magnitude (combined with estuarine flow and tides) produce an eddy, only fluctuating winds with timescales and magnitudes typical of the region result in an eddy with a westward extent similar to seasonal observations. With each period of upwelling-favorable winds, newly upwelled water from the coast is entrained into the eddy which grows in size and moves westward. Wind events also significantly affect the baroclinic structure of the eddy. Specifically, during typical summer wind reversals, model surface drifters continue to move cyclonically within the eddy for several days after each downwelling wind event. Under upwelling-favorable wind conditions, model drifters exit the eddy to the southeast as the eddy and coastal upwelling fronts merge into a continuous southeastward shelf break jet.

	abstract = {In this work, Pratt and Stern's quasigeostrophic, 1 1/2-layer, infinite jet model is connected to a western boundary by a system of two converging boundary currents. The model has a piecewise constant potential vorticity structure and the departing jet has a zonal cusplike profile in the ocean interior. The relative strengths of the coastal jets can be varied and the coastline can be tilted relative to north. The coastline tilt and the coastal current asymmetry cause an alongshore momentum imbalance that creates a spatially damped, quasi-stationary wave pattern. The presence of the boundary favors the long waves in the model, which behave fairly linearly in all study cases. The effects of the coastline tilt and the coastal current asymmetry are varied to reinforce or cancel each other. In the former case, a retroflection type of boundary current separation, like the one observed in most Southern Hemisphere western boundary currents, is obtained. In the latter case, a much smoother separation results, as when the Gulf Stream leaves the North American coast. In order to comply with the piecewise constant potential vorticity constraint, the beta effect is included in the model only very crudely. The “beta” term in the potential vorticity relationship is totally compensated for by a steady flow pattern similar to the edge between two Fofonoff gyres. It is found that when beta is nonzero, the wavelengths are somewhat shorter than those of f-plane cases.},

Accurately describing the circulation of the ACC is made difficult owing to the prominent role that mesoscale eddies and jets, oceanic equivalents of atmospheric storms and storm tracks, have in setting the density structure and transport properties of the current. The successes and limitations of different representations of eddy processes in models of the ACC are considered, with particular attention given to how the circulation responds to changes in wind forcing. The dynamics of energetic eddies and topographically steered jets may both temper and enhance the sensitivity of different aspects of the ACC's circulation to changes in climate.},

Operational difficulties associated with ship spray and flow distortion and with sensor calibration, response and contamination are discussed. The influence of atmospheric stability on the dissipation measurements and the bulk transfer coefficients is considered and a parameterization of Z/ L in terms of wind speed and the sea-air potential temperature difference is found to be adequate. Temperature variances, Stanton numbers and w–t cospectra from the Roynolds flux measurements are compared to previous results. The dissipation method is shown to be a viable means of measuring the heal fluxes over the deep sea by comparison with simultaneous Reynolds flux measurements, using our data for the sensible heat and the data of others for the latent heat.

	doi = {10.5194/tc-5-259-2011},
	abstract = {The response of ice streams to ocean tides is investigated. Numerical modelling experiments are conducted using a two-dimensional flow-line model of coupled ice-stream and ice-shelf flow. The model includes all components of the equilibrium equations, and uses a non-linear viscoelastic constitutive equation for ice. Basal sliding is simulated with a Weertman type sliding law where basal sliding is proportional to some power of the basal shear stress. The response of ice-streams to tidal forcing is found to be profoundly affected by mechanical conditions at the bed. For a non-linear sliding law, a non-linear interaction between the two main semi-diurnal tidal constituents (M2 and S2) can give rise to a significant perturbation in ice-stream flow at the lunisolar synodic fortnightly (MSf) tidal period of 14.76 days. For a linear sliding law, in contrast, no such modulation in flow at the MSf frequency is found. For vertical ocean tides of the type observed on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS), the amplitude of the horizontal modulation in ice-stream flow at the MSf frequency resulting from a non-linear interaction between the S2 and M2 tidal constitutes can be larger than the direct response at the S2 and the M2 frequencies. In comparison the non-linear interaction between K1 and O1 tidal components is weak. As a consequence, modelled ice-stream response to mixed oceanic tides of the type found on FRIS is stronger at the MSf period of 14.76 days than at both the semi-diurnal and diurnal frequencies, while at the same time almost absent at the similar Mf period of 13.66 days. The model results compare favourably with measurements of tidally induced flow variations on Rutford Ice Stream (RIS), West Antarctica. On RIS a strong tidal response is found at the MSf frequency with a smaller response at the semi-diurnal and diurnal frequencies, and almost no response at the Mf frequency. A non-linear viscous sliding law appears to have the potential to fully explain these observations.},
